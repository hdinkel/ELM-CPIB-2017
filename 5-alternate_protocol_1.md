# Alternate Protocol 1: Searching the ELM database using REST API


## Necessary Resources

### Software

Ideally use `curl` https://curl.haxx.se/ on the commandline
However, any browser can be used to access the server, most browsers however download text- and csv-files instead of displaying them. Therefore, for trying out different URLs / Parameters, it might be better to use a commandline client such as `curl`.

## Downloading all ELM classes

step 1. Direct your browser to the url 'http://elm.eu.org/downloads' or choose 'ELM Downloads' from the Menu at 'http://elm.eu.org'.

>>> This webpage contains links and descriptions on how to download ELM data in text format.
>>> The information is separated in individual tables, eg. for 'Classes', 'Instances', and so on...
>>> Note that each table also shows the 'last modified date' indicating when the particular data was last updated.
>>> This is useful if you regularly want to update your local data with ELM data, as you can quickly check whether you actually _need_ to download the files again...
>>> The [/Figures/elm_downloads_html.png](screenshot) shows the ELM downloads website.
>>> Note the orange colored download links highlighting different formats: 
>>> For many pages, which exist in html format (ending in '.html'), there also exists an additional URL/file extension to get the data in other formats.

step 2. Click on the first orange 'html' link in the table "Classes" or use the following URL: 'http://elm.eu.org/elms.html'

>>> This webpage shows all annotated ELM classes.
>>> Next, we are going to use the query parameter 'q' to limit our search

step 3. Use the following URL: 'http://elm.eu.org/elms.html?q=CSK'

>>> This will again show the webpage with all annotated ELM classes, this time however limited to those matching the query term 'PCSK'.
>>> Next, we are going to use the same URL pattern, but with '.tsv' to download the same data as actual data, not HTML.

step 4. Use the following URL: 'http://elm.eu.org/elms.tsv?q=CSK'

>>> By exchanging the '.html' part of the url with '.tsv', we ask the webserver to give us the data in TSV (tab-separated) format.
>>> This query should download a file such as the following:
>>> 
>>> #ELM_Classes_Download_Version: 1.4
>>> #ELM_Classes_Download_Date: 2016-11-06 17:39:41.503341
>>> #Origin: elm.eu.org
