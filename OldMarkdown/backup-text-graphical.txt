step 9. The remainder of the figure (from row 6 onwards) displays the motif
   detections, overlayed by the structural context from rows 2 and 3 (SMART
   domains and GlobPlot).  A blue square indicates a single motif occurence,
   intensity of the color indicates the conservation of this sequence in
   homologous proteins.
   Boxes in gray are motif occurences which have been filtered out by the "structure
   filter". Boxes that are blue & gray are neutral (what does that mean ?????).
   If the sequence is already present in the database, any motif instances
   that have already been annotated are shown as ovals. Lastly, Any motifs
   detected in homologous sequences are also shown as blue & red rectangles.

> In the case that no homologous sequences were detected (see step XXX below),
> it is not possible to assign a conservation score. Therefore all of the
> motif occurences will be shown in a uniform shade of blue.

step 10. Mouse over a motif hit:vsp 
 (which has not been filtered out by the structural
   filter) to detail the motif name and its start and stop positions. This
   box also shows the amino acid sequence which matched the motif, as well as
   the confidence score. The color of the confidence score title box is also
   suggestive of how confident this motif hit is: red for low confidence,
   green for high confidence, as a color spectrum.

> The confidence score is based on ???. And we can use it to interpret the
> motif occurrences ???

step 11. Mouse over a gray rectangle (filtered out) to find out why this hit was
   filtered out. It shows scores for all of the individual criteria used to
   filter out a sequence: The name of the domain, the *accessibility score* ,
   *secondary structure score*, *combined total score*, and the associated
   *totalscore P-value*. It also shows the sequence which cased matched the
   motif's regular expression.
