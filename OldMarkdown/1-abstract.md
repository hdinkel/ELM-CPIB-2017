# Abstract

*instructions: brief overview, no references, max 150 words*

The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource (http://elm.eu.org) is a manually curated database of short linear motifs (SLiMs).
This protocol explains how to best use this resource and explains 
how to access the database content (both manual and scripted access),
how to interpret the output,
and how to predict novel putative motifs in any given protein sequence.
