    The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource (\rurl{elm.eu.org}) is a
manually curated database of short linear motifs (SLiMs). This protocol
explains how to best use this resource and explains how to access the
database content (both manual and scripted access), how to interpret the
output, and how to predict novel putative motifs in any given protein
sequence.

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The activity and function of a protein is tightly regulated by its
cellular environment. To interact with their surroundings, proteins use
various types of binding modules that each display distinct binding
properties \cite{10550212}. One prominent type of binding module
consists of short linear motifs (SLiMs) \cite{18508681}. These compact
binding sites are generally located in intrinsically disordered regions
(IDR) of the proteome and commonly bind to
surfaceof a globular domain in a protein \cite{21909575}. SLiMs mediate
different types of interactions that regulate protein functionality, and hence
are important regulators of the dynamic processes involved in cell
signalling (\cite{22480932}) (\cite{24926813}). The number of
SLiM instances in the human proteome is currently suggested to be over
one million \cite{25038412}. Identifying SLiMs and elucidating their
functionality is an essential step in understanding cell regulation. The
Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource contributes to this process by
providing the necessary tools to researchers working on motifs. It
consists of a database and a prediction tool. The database provides a
categorised repository of experimentally validated linear motif classes
and instances that were manually annotated form the literature. The ELM
prediction tool in turn relies on annotated data, both from the ELM
database and other resources, to accurately analyse unknown sequences
for candidate motifs and assist researchers in selecting the most
plausible ones for experimental validation and discard likely false
positive hits, saving them valuable time and assets \cite{22110040}.
The following protocols will guide users through the different ELM
applications, explaining how to browse the curated data available in
ELM, how to analyse a protein sequence for putative motifs, and how to
interpret these data and avoid common pitfalls in SLiM discovery.

\section{(Basic): Explore the content of the ELM DB}
\label{sec:explore_content}

The core of the ELM database is a repository of manually annotated motifs and
instances. As of December 2016, ELM contains over 260 motif classes categorized
into 6 different types: DOC (docking), LIG (Ligand binding), DEG (degradation),
CLV (cleavage), MOD (post translational modifications), and TRG
(targeting/anchoring) motifs (Figure functional\_classification\_of\_SLiMs).
These motifs are derived from various types of experiments reported in
literature. Each manually annotated motif also has a set of bona fide instances
(occurrences) of this motif. Currently, there are over 3000 annotated instances
annotated from over 2500 publications. The motif classes and motif instances
have been uploaded by a large group of annotators from around the globe. The
complete catalogue of manually curated data can be searched, browsed and
explored on the ELM website

TODO MARC: explain: elms, annotations, classes, instances, regular expressions. And links to GO, methods PSI. we use DOC CYCLIN etc as example.

\item Use the general search field (on the top of the page) to do a general
	seach for P53 using its Uniprot identifier by typing ``P04637'' in the

	The results are grouped into matching instances
	(Fig. \ref{fig:general_search_P04637_instances})
	candidate classes and switches

\item Perform a search using the keyword ``p53'' in the general search field
	instead of its Uniprot identifier ``P04637''.
	The set of results retrieved using this term as search query
	(Fig. \ref{fig:general_search_TP53_instances})
	in this case are different, returning 31 instances and 44
	switches (instead of 14 and 11). The reason for this is that the
	phrase ``P53'' also matches the Uniprot identifier of
	\uniprot{CDH1\_YEAST} (P53197). This is important to keep in mind when
	using the general search field.

\section{(Basic) Predicting ELMs in proteins}
\label{sec:predicting_p53}

One of the most useful (and used) features in ELM is the ability to
detect motifs in proteins and sequences. Given a protein's amino acid
sequence, the ``EML Predictions'' pipeline searches for occurrences of
each motif class using regular expressions, applies a set of filters to
remove false positives and creates a diagram to visualize resulting
set of putative motifs.

In this protocol we will be viewing the manually annotated data of a
typical protein, using p53 (Uniprot ID: \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN}/P04637) as an
example. We will cover how to find the manually annotated motifs and instances,
and how to find the motif instances, the references used to annotate each
instance, the experimental protocols used, and additional information including
relationships to biological pathways (KEGG), diseases (OMIM) and molecular
switches (switches.ELM).

	\label{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}
\end{figure}

\item Open a browser, and navigate to the ELM homepage: http://elm.eu.org.
	Enter the Uniprot ID \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} in the search field labelled
	``Enter a uniprot identifier or accession number''. The page should
	autocomplete/suggest the protein ``\uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} / P04637 (Homo
	sapiens)'' (Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}).
	Click on this entry to confirm that we want to search for
	motifs in this protein. Click on \button{Submit} to submit the query to
	the server.

	\sdesc{The autocompletion mechanism queries Uniprot for protein
		identifier; if it succeeds, then additional information from
		Uniprot will be used to pre-populate the filter boxes. In this
		example, \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} is recognized as a Human protein,
		and so ``Homo sapiens'' is automatically filled in the
		``Taxonomic Context'' field. Also, P53 has been annotated (by
		Uniprot) to be localized to nucleus, cytosol, endoplasmic
		reticulum and mitochondrion, so these are also automatically
		applied as search criteria. The motif cutoff of ``100'' is a
		sufficiently high (lenient) threshold to allow all other
		detected motifs to be shown.}

\item Select the search criteria (optional). It is possible to limit the
	results by ``cell compartment'', ``taxonomic context'' or by changing
	the ``motif probability cutoff''. To restrict the search to include
	motifs that are active in certain cellular compartments, select one or
	more from the list (use the ``control'' key to select more than one
	option). It is also possible to select a ``taxonomic context'' to
	restrict the search to motifs from certain species. Start typing a
	species name in the ``taxonomic context'' input field to get an
	auto-completed list of species to select from. Additionally, a ``Motif
	probability cutoff'' can be used to only retain ELM classes whose
	pattern probability is below the given value. For the current protocol,
	leave all of these at their default values: ``not specified'', ``100''
	and no ``taxonomic context''

\subsection{Interpreting the prediction results: Graphical Summary}
\label{subsec:predicting_p53_graphical_summary}

\item Click \button{submit} to start searching for motifs. You will be brought
	to an intermediate page indicating that your results are being
	processed, and should be redirected to the final results page
	within a minute. You can bookmark this page: The results are stored for
	a week.

	\sdesc{The Results are summarized in the first figure on the results
		page (see figure \ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}).
		The graphical summary shows the
		results generated by the ELM prediction pipeline, combined with
		additional filters and information from external resources. The
		visualization should help you interpreting the results and to
		assess whether or not a motif is present in a sequence, as well
		as how likely it is to be functional based on its structural
		context and evolutionary conservation. Motif instances which
		are manually annotated in the database appear as red (TP) or
		yellow (FP) ovals in the graphic. Blue/gray squares represent
		predicted motif occurrences.}

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/predicting_p53/elm_results_summary.png} 
	\caption{
	The graphical results summary of the ELM Prediction pipeline for
	\uniprot{P53\_HUMAN}. Note that not all motif detections are shown (the
	image is truncated at the bottom). The top five rows show a set of
	structural features. Annotated and predicted motifs are shown as
	differently colored ovals/boxes. The info screens for two motifs are

	}
	\label{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}
\end{figure}

\item The first row contains phosphorylation sites as retrieved from
	phospho.ELM \cite{21062810}, and whether the phosphorylated amino
	acid is a serine, threonine or tyrosine. Phospho.ELM is a database of
	manually annotated phosphorylation sites obtained from scientific
	publications from low and high-throughput experiments. You can follow
	the link to phospho.ELM by clicking on the phosphorylation site in the
	image to get more information on individual phosphorylation sites.

	\sdesc{Phosphorylation sites are only available when the search is
		performed with a protein accession (eg. \emph{not} with a FASTA
		sequence alone) in step 1 and there is relevant information
		annotated in the phospho.ELM database. Phosphorylation sites
		are relevant to interpret ELM motif predictions when the
		predicted motif requires to be phosphorylated (as in several
		docking and ligand binding motifs) and for predicting 
		phosphorylation motifs.}

\item The second row shows SMART and Pfam domains detected by the SMART
	database \cite{9600884, 25300481, 9600884}
	(Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}). Hover the
	mouse over these domains to see their names and exact start and end
	positions.

	\sdesc{ In order to be functional motifs to be accessible, and
		therefore they are usually not found within globular domains
		and structured regions (\cite{21909575}). Any motifs detected
		by the ELM prediction pipeline inside of a smart domain are
		less likely to be functional, and are shown as a gray box
		background (see also the ``structural filter'' described in
		step XXX). }

\item The third row shows globular and disordered regions in the
	sequence as predicted by GlobPlot (\cite{12824398}). The fourth
	and fifth rows
	contain results from IUPred (\cite{15955779}), another
	predictor of disordered protein regions. Protein segments with
	an IUPred score above 0.5 are considered to be disordered.

	\sdesc{Motifs are typically only functional when found in intrinsically
		disordered regions. Any motif occurrence detected by the ELM
		prediction pipeline that falls within disordered regions are
		more likely to be functional.}

\item The 5th row (Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}) contains
	information on secondary structure. The secondary structure is
	predicted using a pipeline mapping motif occurrence onto high quality
	reference domain structures \cite{19852836}. Check the graphical
	representation, and if the output of the secondary structure filter and
	the disorder predictors agree with respect to which parts of the
	sequence are considered structured and which disordered.

\item The remainder of the figure (below ``secondary structure'' output)
	displays predicted and annotated motif instances, overlayed with the
	structural context from rows 2 and 3 (SMART domains and GlobPlot). A
	blue square indicates a single motif occurrence, and intensity of the
	color indicates the conservation of this sequence across a group of in
	homologous proteins.
	Boxes in gray are motif occurrences which have been filtered out by the
	structure filter. Boxes that are blue \& gray are neutral (
	residing in structural context, but the secondary structure detected a
	loop region). If the sequence is already present in the ELM database,
	any motif instances that have already been annotated are shown as
	ovals. Lastly, any motifs detected which are annotated to be
	functional in homologous sequences, are shown as red \& blue
	rectangles.

	\sdesc{ In the case that not enough homologous sequences were detected
		to build an alignment, no conservation score can be calculated.
		Therefore all of the motif occurrences will be shown in a
		uniform shade of blue. }

TODO: EXPLAIN / SHOW ANNOTATED INSTANCES Marc: Use mouse over in this figure.

\item Place the cursor over the blue box for motif occurrence 
	\motif{CLV\_C14\_Caspase3-7} at the end of the sequence (
	position 388-392). This will trigger the green and yellow 
	information screen shown on the top right in Fig.
	\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}.
	This motif is in a disordered region, and has not been
	filtered out by the structural filter. Also, its conservation score
	of 0.910 is very high, indicating that this motif is highly conserved.

	\sdesc{The confidence score is based on how conserved the sequence is
		across a set of homologous proteins from other sequences. An
		full description of the method can be found in \cite{18460207}.
		The higher the conservation score (max. 1), the more conserved
		the motif's sequence is, and the more likely it is a functional
		motif for this prediction.}

\item Place the cursor over the blue \& gray rectangle for motif
	\motif{CLV\_PCSK\_SKI1\_1} at position 120-124, a motif 
	which was flagged as ``neutral'' by the ELM prediction pipeline.
	This will trigger the information screen (with the pink header) shown
	in Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary} to appear.
	This motif resides inside of the P53 Pfam domain, and thus has been
	subjected to ``structural filtering''. However, the secondary structure
	prediction suggests this motif occurs within the looped regioun of this
	domain, so may be accessible.

	\sdesc{The information screen pop-up 
	shows scores for all of the individual criteria used by the secondary
	structure filter: The name of the domain, the \emph{accessibility
	score} , \emph{secondary structure score}, \emph{combined total score},
	and the associated \emph{total score P-value} \cite{19852836}.}

	The first two lines contain information on whether
	and which filters were applied in step 1 of this protocol.
	In this case 4 motifs (elms) representing 26 instances were filtered
	out as they did not occur in \textit{Homo sapies}. An additional 5
	motifs (representing 11 instances) were filtered out becuase they are
	not annotated to the cell compartments automatically filled in on the
	search page (Step 1).
	The next three lines (``SMART'' \& ``Structural score'') show how many
	motifs and instances were not removed by the SMART and Secondary
	structure filters. A total of 42 motifs (representing 106 instances)
	passed the structural filter.

%%% Predicting via REST API

\section{(Alternate) Predicting ELMS in sequences using the API}
\label{sec:predicting_REST}

Querying ELM for motifs in a given sequence (as described in
\ref{sec:predicting_p53} and \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974}), gives you a nice
overview of putative and possibly
annotated motifs in your query protein with a graphical representation
using colors to highlight different regions of the protein sequence (eg.
disordered vs.~globular). It is however difficult to analyse a large set
of protein sequences in this manner. Therefore, the ELM server
provides an interface which you can use to submit your sequence in a
programmatic way. Of course, this way, you won't receive the graphical
output representation, but are limited to textual data representation.

Currently, there exists a single URL (\code{http://elm.eu.org/start\_search/})
to accept such queries. You can choose to either submit a uniprot name
or accession (eg. \code{http://elm.eu.org/start\_search/P53\_HUMAN.tsv}) or
submit your raw sequence
(e.g.\code{http://elm.eu.org/start\_search/MAPRGFSCLLLLTSEIDLPVKRRA'}.)
If the URL ends in `.tsv' then the server assumes you
are using a Uniprot id or accession; if it doesn't, then it assumes you
are using raw sequence. See below for details.

\section{(Alternate) Searching the ELM database using the REST API}
\label{sec:search_REST}

Many researchers are interested in large-scale analyses rather than
information about individual protein sequences. To this end, individual
queries to the ELM webserver with a single protein id at a time, are not
practical.

For this reason, as much information as possible is made available via a
REST interface \cite{Fielding2002}. This allows the user to interact
with the ELM database and ELM webserver via scriptable URL requests.
Each request can easily be tested in the browser before it is being
automated in a script.

In this section we will explore the various ways in which data can
downloaded both in using the browser as well as via the commandline.

	The ELM downloads page, which holds
	information about the different types of data (such as ``Classes'',
	``Instances'', etc; see menu to the right) that can be obtained from the
	server. The orange boxes are clickable links, the URL following them are
	used to highlight the URL scheme used by the server (bold font denotes
	specifics used in the examples such as query terms, or formats).
	}
	\label{fig:search_REST_downloads}
\end{figure}

\item Direct your browser to the URL \rurl{elm.eu.org/downloads} or select
	`ELM Downloads' from the main menu
	(Fig. \ref{fig:search_REST_downloads}).
	This page contains links and descriptions on how to download ELM data
	in text format. The datasets are split into several smaller collections
	(for example ``Classes'', ``Instances'', etc). Each table contains
	links (in orange) to download the data in various formats.

	\sdesc{Each table also shows the `last modified date' indicating when
		the data was last updated. This is useful if you want to know
		when to update your local data with the most up to date ELM
		data. }

\item Click on the first orange `html' link in the table ``Classes'' to
	navigate to the following URL:
	\rurl{elm.eu.org/elms/elm\_index.html}. This page shows all of the
	annotated ELM classes in the database. This page is the same one as
	shown in figure \ref{fig:explore_content_elms}.

\item Navidate to the folling URL: \rurl{elm.eu.org/elms.html?q=CSK'}
	specifying \code{q=CSK} to limit the list of ELMs to those matching the
	search query ``CSK''. This page is again similar to the one shown in
	figure \ref{fig:explore_content_elms}, but with less classes.

	\sdesc{ This search result is identical to the result you would obtain
		by doing a ``manual'' search on the ELM Classes page
		described in step 3 of \ref{sec:explore_content}
		(Fig. \ref{fig:explore_content_elms}).}


\item Open the following URL: \rurl{elm.eu.org/elms.tsv?q=CSK} to download a
	list of classes that match the search query ``CSK'' (as in the previous
	step) in the ``tab separated values'' format. By exchanging the
	\fileformat{.html} part of the url with \fileformat{.tsv}', we ask the
	webserver to give us the data in ``tab-separated values'' format.

	\sdesc{ Depending on which browser you are using, the file may open
		directly in your browser, or you may be prompted to download
		the file or save it to a separate location. In the latter two
		cases you can open the downloaded file using a (plain) text

	download the same data from the previous step directly into the
	terminal:
	\code{curl 'http://elm.eu.org/elms/elms\_index.tsv?q=CSK'}.  The output
	should look similar to figure \ref{fig:search_REST_curl_csk}.

\item To download a list of all motif instances detected in Human P53, type the
	followin command into a terminal: \code{curl
	'http://elm.eu.org/instances.gff?q=p53\_human'}. The output should look
	similar to that shown in figure \ref{fig:predicting_REST_curl_p53}. The
	output is in the ``General Feature Format''
	(see \rurl{www.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html\#moreinfo}),
	with the FASTA formatted sequence appended to the end of the output.  

	\sdesc{ Many other file formats are available for downloading instances
		annotations, including the \fileformat{fasta},
		\fileformat{gff}, \fileformat{pir}, OR PSI-MI format (either

\item To download a list of all instances matchin th search query ``CLV'' in
	the yellow fever mosquito (\textit{Aedes agypti}), enter the following
	command into a terminal:
	\code{curl `http://elm.eu.org/instances.tsv?q=CLV\&taxon=aedes+aegypti'}.
	In general any species name can be used, always replacing the ``space''
	with a ``+''. This should return a single instance, the only one
	matching CLV in \textit{A. aegypti}.

\item More data (interactions, domains, methods, etc.) can be downloaded from
	ELM in analogous fashion as shown in the preceeding steps. Take a look
	at the ELM Downloads page (http://elm.eu.org/downloads, figure
	\ref{fig:search_REST_downloads}) for an overview of which datasets can
	be downloaded, and what the different possible filters and formats are
	for each dataset.

\subsection*{Background Information}\label{background-information}

In order to interpret the data contained in ELM and the results produced by the
ELM prediction tool, it is important to have a basic understanding of SLiM's
and how they are affected by their structural and biological context. This 
background information summarises the different functionalities of SLiMs, 
describes the degenerate nature of motif sequences, and emphasises the need for 
contextual data for confident SLiM prediction.

\subsubsection*{ELM categorises SLiMs depending on their functionality}

SLiMs mediate different types of interactions, and based on this functionality, 
the ELM classes annotated in the ELM database are grouped into six main ELM 
types (Figure \ref{fig:SLiMclasses}) (\cite{24214962}). They can function as ligand binding sites or 
as sites for post-translational modification (PTM). Some ligand SLiMs are 
recognised by components of the cellular transport machinery and function as 
localisation signals that target proteins to specific sub-cellular compartments 
(TRG type). Other ligand SLiMs are abundantly present in interfaces that mediate 
the assembly of large macromolecular complexes and in highly modular scaffold 
proteins that act as multivalent platforms for protein complex assembly 
(LIG type). Docking motifs are ligand SLiMs that recruit modification enzymes to 
their substrates by binding to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the 
active site (DOC type). A subset of these, known as degrons, recruit ubiquitin 
ligases, which subsequently polyubiquitylate their substrates and hence target 
them for proteasomal degradation (DEG type). SLiMs that act as sites for PTM can 
be targeted by specific enzymes for the addition or removal of a small chemical 
group (e.g. phosphorylation), a sugar molecule (e.g. glycosylation), a protein 
(e.g. ubiquitylation), or another moiety (e.g. lipidation) (MOD type). Other PTM 
SLiMs mediate proteolytic cleavage by acting as target site for proteolytic 
enzymes (CLV type), or are recognised for structural modification by isomerases 
that catalyse cis-trans isomerisation of the peptide backbone (DOC type) 
\cite{24926813, 24773235}.

\subsubsection*{ELM regular expressions reflect the degenerate nature of SLiMs}

As their name suggests, SLiMs are compact, being composed of a limited number of 
adjacent amino acids. Most of a motif’s binding specificity however is conferred 
by only a subset of these amino acids. Those few residues that directly interact 
with the binding partner are evolutionary conserved, although in many cases a 
subset of amino acids that share certain properties (such as similar charge, 
size or hydrophobicity) are allowed in these hotspot positions. In the motif 
positions that contribute little to the interaction, there are even less 
constraints, i.e. a broader range of amino acids is allowed in these positions 
\cite{21909575}. This sequence flexibility is captured in the regular 
expressions that are defined for each motif class. A first consequence of this 
degeneracy is that SLiMs co-operatively engage in interactions of relatively low 
affinity. Hence these binding events are transient and reversible, and can be 
readily modulated, for instance by PTM. These characteristics make SLiM-based 
interactions ideal mediators of the dynamic processes involved in cell 
signalling \cite{22480932}. Another consequence is that it might take only a few 
or even a single point mutation to generate or disrupt a functional motif in a 
protein. The associated ability to evolve convergently might underlie the 
proliferation of SLiMs and the rewiring of interactomes \cite{26589632,
22346764}. Conversely, several SLiM-associated diseases have been 
characterised to date, for instance Liddle syndrome \cite{15483078}.

\subsubsection*{ELM integrates data to increase the confidence of SLiM prediction*}

Due to their degenerate nature, motif sequences contain only very little 
information, and many short sequences in a proteome will match motif patterns. 
However, most of these matches will not represent functional motifs, and hence, 
when scanning a proteome for putative motifs using only the motif sequence 
patterns will yield a large number of false positive instances, far exceeding 
the number of true motifs. Therefore, reliable motif detection cannot go without 
experimental validation of candidate motifs, using different types of 
experiments and techniques \cite{26581338}. This however does not mean that 
bioinformatics analysis cannot guide researchers towards a subset of candidate 
motifs that have a higher probability to be functional and help rule out those 
candidate motifs that are likely to be false positives. Taking into account 
additional information, besides a match to a sequence pattern defining a SLiM, 
can greatly narrow the selection of putative motifs for experimental validation. 
Additional data for in silico analysis include conservation of the motif 
sequence, the location of the motif within the protein’s structure and its 
accessibility for its binding partner, validated interaction with the binding 
partner, and in-cell co-localisation with the binding partner. The availability 
and usefulness of these additional data for SLiM discovery depends on their 
extensive and correct biocuration. A vast and increasing amount of biological 
data is available in a wide variety of sources, including the literature and 
large-scale datasets. In order to facilitate integration of data, they need to 
be collected, annotated and formatted in central data and knowledge 
repositories. The ELM database provides such a repository for experimentally 
validated linear motif classes and instances. The ELM prediction tool in turn 
relies on annotated data, both from the ELM database and other resources, to 
accurately analyse unknown sequences for candidate motifs and assist researchers 
in selecting the most plausible ones for experimental validation and discard 
likely false positive hits, saving them valuable time and assets 
\cite{22110040}.

were experimentally validated to be functional motifs are captured as ELM
instances of that class. Degrons are a specific subtype of enzyme-recruiting
docking motifs (see text for a detailed description).
