\section*{Significance Statement}

Short linear motifs (SLiMs) are compact, degenerate and often unstructured
peptide sequences that function as interaction modules in a protein. They play
essential roles in cell signalling, the cell cycle, intracellular trafficking,
and disease, and the number of different motifs is believed to be in the order
of millions. Yet, despite their abundance and importance, our understanding of
which motifs exist and how they function is still limited, as SLiMs have proven
difficult to study both experimentally and computationally. The Eukaryotic
Linear Motif (ELM) resource is an online database containing over 3000 manually
curated SLiM instances from experimental literature, and a pipeline to detect
SLiMs in protein sequences. ELM is a valuable resource to the scientific
community studying protein function.

\begin{abstract}%

The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource (\rurl{elm.eu.org}) is dedicated to
the characterization and prediction of short linear motifs (SLiMs). SLiMs
are compact, degenerate peptide segments found in many proteins and
essential to almost all cellular processes. However, despite their
abundance, SLiMs remain largely uncharacterized. The ELM database is a
collection of manually annotated SLiM instances curated from experimental
literature. In this article we illustrate how to browse and search the
database for curated SLiM data, and cover the different types of data
integrated in the resource. We also cover how to use this resource in order
to predict SLiMs in known as well as novel proteins, and how to interpret
the results generated by the ELM prediction pipeline. The ELM database is a
very rich resource, and in the following protocols we give helpful examples
to demonstrate how this knowledge can be used to improve your own research.

\section*{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

The activity and function of a protein is tightly regulated by its
cellular environment. To interact with their surroundings, proteins use
various types of binding modules that each display distinct binding
properties \citep{10550212}. One prominent type of binding module
consists of short linear motifs (SLiMs) \citep{18508681}. These compact
binding sites are generally located in intrinsically disordered regions
(IDR) of the proteome and commonly bind to the
surface of a globular domain in a protein \citep{21909575}. SLiMs mediate
different types of interactions that regulate protein functionality, and hence
are important regulators of the dynamic processes involved in cell
signalling \citep{22480932} \citep{24926813}. The number of
SLiM instances in the human proteome is currently suggested to be over
one million \citep{25038412}. Identifying SLiMs and elucidating their
functionality is thus an essential step in understanding cell regulation.
The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource contributes to this process by
providing the necessary tools to researchers working on motifs. It
consists of a database and a prediction tool. The database provides a
categorised repository of experimentally validated linear motif classes
and instances that were manually curated from the literature. The ELM
prediction tool in turn relies on annotated data, both from the ELM
database and other resources, to accurately analyse sequences
for candidate motifs and assist researchers in selecting the most
plausible ones for experimental validation and discard likely false
positive hits, saving them valuable time and resources \citep{22110040}.
The following protocols will guide users through the different ELM
applications, explaining how to browse the curated data available in
ELM, how to analyse a protein sequence for putative motifs, and how to
interpret these data and avoid common pitfalls in SLiM discovery.

\section{Exploring the Content of the ELM Database}%
\label{sec:explore_content}%

The core of the ELM database is a repository of manually annotated motif classes
and instances. As of January 2017, ELM contains over 260 motif classes and over
3000 experimentally validated and manually curated motif instances. The motif
classes and instances have been uploaded by a large group of annotators from
around the globe. The complete catalogue of manually curated data can be
searched, browsed and explored on the ELM website.

Each motif class describes a SLiM, a short sequence of amino acids with a
dedicated function. Since motifs are often degenerate, each motif class is
defined by a regular expression, a symbolic representation expressing a complex
pattern of letters (or in this case amino acids). For example, the regular
expression ``\motif{[FY].L.P}'' indicates a peptide sequence with a
phenylalanine '\motif{F}' or a tyrosine '\motif{Y}' in the first position,
followed by any amino acid '\motif{.}', then a leucine '\motif{L}', one more
arbitrary amino acid '\motif{.}' and finally a proline '\motif{P}'.

In all cases, the annotator condenses information from the primary and secondary
literature into manageable abstracts, accompanies the motif definition with a
list of experimental instances, and adds links to external resources for
proteins, biological pathways, and diseases. In this protocol we explore the
various data types stored in the database, as well as links to external
resources.

\section{Exploring the Content of the ELM Database Using the General Search}
\label{sec:general_search}

A general search text box is available to query the entire collection of
manually curated information in the ELM database. This search field can be found in the header
of the ELM database website (see for example Fig.
\ref{fig:general_search_TP53_instances}). This search performs a full-text
query across multiple selected data sources in the ELM database, including
ELM classes, instances, candidates, and switches. Using this general search is helpful
to get information about a particular protein and its annotation status in the
ELM database (eg. full instance vs. candidate).

	In this case, the results are grouped into matching instances

	candidate classes and switches
	(Figure~\ref{fig:general_search_P04637_switches}).
	As there are no classes with ``P04637'' in the name or description, no classes are
	returned for this section of the query.

\section{Detecting Short Linear Motifs in Protein Sequences}
\label{sec:predicting_p53}

One of the most useful (and used) features in ELM is the ability to
detect motifs in proteins and peptide sequences. Given a protein's amino acid
sequence, the ``ELM Predictions'' pipeline searches for occurrences of
each motif class using regular expressions, applies a set of filters to
minimize false positives and creates a diagram to visualize the resulting
set of putative motifs.

In this protocol we will be viewing the manually annotated data of a
typical protein, using p53 (UniProt ID: \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN}/P04637) as an
example. We will cover how to find the manually annotated motifs and instances,
the references used to annotate each
instance, the experimental protocols used, and additional information including
relationships to biological pathways (KEGG), diseases (OMIM) and molecular
switches (switches.ELM).

	}
	\label{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}
\end{figure}

\item Open a browser and navigate to the ELM homepage: \url{http://elm.eu.org}.\label{sec:predicting_p53_elm_search}
	Enter the UniProt ID \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} in the search field labelled
	``Enter a UniProt identifier or accession number''. While typing, the page should
	autocomplete your input ``\uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} / P04637 (\textit{Homo
	sapiens})'' and already pre-fill other fields of the input form (Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}).
	Click on this entry to confirm that you want to search for
	motifs in this protein. Click on \button{Submit} to send the query to
	the server.

	\sdesc{The autocompletion mechanism queries UniProt for the given protein
		identifier; if it succeeds, additional information from
		UniProt will be used to auto-populate the input boxes. In this
		example, \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} is recognized as a human protein,
		and so ``Homo sapiens'' is automatically filled in the
		``Taxonomic Context'' field. Also, p53 has been annotated (by
		UniProt) to be localized to nucleus, cytosol, endoplasmic
		reticulum and mitochondrion, so these are also automatically
		applied as search criteria. The motif cutoff of ``100'' is a
		sufficiently high (lenient) threshold to ensure no motif class
		is filtered out based on motif probability.}

\item Select the search criteria (optional).
	To restrict the search to include
	motifs that are active only in certain cellular compartments, select one or
	more from the ``Cell compartment'' list (use the ``control'' key to select more than one
	option). It is also possible to select a ``Taxonomic Context'' to
	restrict the search to motifs from certain species. Start typing a
	species name in the ``Taxonomic Context'' input field to get an
	autocompleted list of species to select from. Additionally, a ``Motif
	probability cutoff'' can be used to only retain ELM classes whose
	pattern probability is below the given value.
	These filters are implemented later in \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974}.
	For now, leave all filters at the default values that were
	auto-populated for p53.

	\sdesc{The results are summarized in the first figure on the results

	\label{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}
\end{figure}

\item \label{sec:predicting_p53_results_phosphorylation} The first row contains phosphorylation sites, as retrieved from
	PhosphoELM \citep{21062810}, and shows whether the phosphorylated amino
	acid is a serine, threonine or tyrosine. PhosphoELM is a database of
	manually annotated phosphorylation sites, obtained from scientific
	publications describing low and high-throughput experiments. You can follow
	the link to PhosphoELM by clicking on the phosphorylation site in the
	image to get more information on individual phosphorylation sites.

	\sdesc{Phosphorylation sites are only available when the search is
		performed with a protein accession (eg. \emph{not} with a FASTA
		sequence alone) in step \ref{sec:predicting_p53_elm_search} and when relevant information

		relevant to interpret ELM motif predictions, for instance when the
		predicted motif is required to be phosphorylated (as in several docking
		and ligand binding motifs) or in the case of a predicted phosphorylation
		motif.}

\item The second row shows SMART and PFAM domains detected by the SMART
	database \citep{9600884, 25300481, 9600884}
	(Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}). Hover the
	mouse over these domains to see their names and exact start and end
	positions.

	\sdesc{In order to be functional, motifs need to be accessible, and
		therefore they are usually not found within globular domains
		or structured regions \citep{21909575}. Any motif detected
		by the ELM prediction pipeline inside a SMART domain is
		less likely to be functional, and therefore is shown with a gray box
		background (see commentary section "Structure Filter" at page \pageref{StructureFilter}).}

\item The third row shows globular and disordered regions in the
	sequence, as predicted by GlobPlot \citep{12824398}. The fourth
	and fifth rows
	contain results from IUPred \citep{15955779}, another
	predictor of disordered protein regions. Protein segments with
	an IUPred score above 0.5 are considered to be disordered
	(see commentary section "Disorder Filter" at page \pageref{DisorderFilter}).

	\sdesc{Motifs are typically only functional when found in intrinsically
		disordered regions. Any motif occurrence detected by the ELM
		prediction pipeline that falls within a disordered region is
		more likely to be functional.}

\item The sixth row (Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}) contains
	information on the protein's structure (see commentary section "Structure Filter" at page \pageref{StructureFilter}).
	The secondary structure is
	predicted by mapping the motif occurrence onto high quality
	reference domain structures \citep{19852836}. Check the graphical
	representation, and whether the output of the secondary structure filter and
	the disorder predictors agree with each other with respect to which parts of the
	sequence are considered structured or disordered.

\item The remainder of the figure (below ``secondary structure'' output)
	displays predicted and annotated motif instances, overlaid with the
	structural context from rows 2 and 3 (SMART domains and GlobPlot). A
	blue square indicates a single motif occurrence, and the intensity of the
	color indicates the conservation of this sequence across a group of
	homologous proteins.
	Boxes in gray are motif occurrences that have been filtered out by the
	structure filter. Boxes that are blue \& gray are neutral, i.e.
	within a globular domain but part of a loop
	according to the secondary structure predictions.
	If a motif instance in this sequence has already been annotated in the ELM
	database, it is shown as an oval. Lastly, any detected motif that is already
	annotated as a functional instance in a homologous sequence, is shown as a
	red \& blue rectangle (see commentary section "Instance Mapper" at
	page \pageref{InstanceMapper}).

	\sdesc{ In the case that not enough homologous sequences were detected
		to build an alignment, no conservation score can be calculated.
		Therefore all of the motif occurrences will be shown in a
		uniform shade of blue. }

\item Place the cursor over the blue box for motif occurrence
	\motif{CLV\_C14\_Caspase3-7} at the end of the sequence (
	position 388--392). This will trigger the green and yellow
	information screen shown on the top right in Fig.
	\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}.
	This motif is in a disordered region, and has not been
	filtered out by the structural filter. Also, its conservation score
	of 0.910 is very high, indicating that this motif is highly conserved.

	\sdesc{The conservation score is based on how conserved the sequence is
		across a set of homologous proteins
		(see commentary section "Conservation Filter" at page \pageref{ConservationFilter}).}

\item \label{sec:predicting_p53_results_structure_filter} Place the cursor over the blue \& gray rectangle for motif
	\motif{CLV\_Separin\_Metazoa} at position 171--175, a motif
	which was flagged as ``neutral'' by the ELM prediction pipeline.
	This will trigger the information screen (with the pink header) shown
	in Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary} to appear.
	This motif resides inside the p53 PFAM domain, and thus has been
	subjected to ``structural filtering''. However, the secondary structure
	prediction suggests that this motif occurs within the looped region of this
	domain, so may be accessible.

	\sdesc{The information screen pop-up
	shows scores for all of the individual criteria used by the secondary
	structure filter: the name of the domain, the accessibility
	score, the secondary structure score, a combined total score,
	and the associated total score P-value \citep{19852836}.}

\item Place the cursor over the red oval for \motif{DEG\_MDM2\_SWIB\_1} at
	position 19--26. This motif is an annotated instance in the
	ELM database, and is therefore a bona-fide experimentally validated
	instance.

	In this case 4 motifs representing 26 instances were filtered

	motifs (representing 11 instances) were filtered out because they are
	not annotated to the cell compartments automatically filled in on the
	search page (step \ref{sec:predicting_p53_elm_search}).
	The next three lines (``SMART'' \& ``Structural score'') show how many
	motifs and instances were not removed by the SMART and Secondary
	structure filters. A total of 42 motifs (representing 106 instances)
	passed the structural filter.

\section{Detecting Short Linear Motifs in Novel Protein Sequences}
\label{sec:predicting_cv_0974}

The ELM motif detection pipeline provides a powerful tool to obtain
information about the putative motifs that are present in a protein sequence and about its structural
context. However, determining which motifs are actually true positive detections
requires interpreting all of these results, as well as incorporating as much
biological knowledge as possible. In this protocol we will be following a typical
example of how one might use the ELM pipeline to search for motifs in novel
sequences.

Some pathogens have evolved short linear motifs in effector proteins to modify
intracellular signalling in their host cells for their own convenience
\citep{25475989}. The Gram-negative bacteria \textit{Chromobacterium violaceum} is an
opportunistic pathogen of humans whose mechanism of pathogenicity remains poorly
understood. Its genome encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) that is used
by different pathogens to translocate bacterial proteins into the infected cells.
Interestingly, the genes encoding this T3SS as well as other genes located in
the same genomic location are very similar to the ones in \textit{Salmonella spp.}, with
the exception of few genes such as the modular protein SptP \citep{15100995}.
SptP in \textit{Salmonella spp.} is a secreted protein tyrosine phosphatase
\citep{8866485} whose closest homolog in \textit{C. violaceum} is the protein
\uniprot{CV\_0974}. To better understand the possible biological function of the
protein \uniprot{CV\_0974}, we will use it as an example application of the
ELM server motif detection pipeline.

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_fasta} Click on the ``ELM Predictions'' button in the menu to access the search
	query page (Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_cv_0974_search}).
	Here you should provide the amino acid sequence of \uniprot{CV\_0974}
	from UniProt (\url{http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7NZE8.fasta}), and
	enter it in FASTA format into the ``sequence input text box''.

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_taxon} In the ``Taxonomic Context'' field, enter the text ``Homo
	sapiens''. This will limit the search to motif classes
	which have been annotated for human proteins.

    \sdesc{Certain human diseases occur when motifs are hijacked by
	    opportunistic pathogens (see Step~\ref{sec:explore_content_viruses} in

	    By limiting the search to
	    human motifs, we will identify motifs which are known to exist
	    in humans and thus may be the target of motif hijacking.
	}

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_compartment} The bacterial protein
\uniprot{CV\_0974} is probably an effector protein, similar to its homologue
SptP. As SptP localizes to the cytosol, we assume the same for \uniprot{CV\_0974},
so you should select ``cytosol'' in the ``Cell compartment'' field.


\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_cutoff} For now, you should set
    the ``Motif probability cutoff'' to the same value you used in
	\ref{subsec:predicting_p53_input} and enter ``100'' into this box.

\item Hit \button{Submit} to send the query to the ELM prediction pipeline.
    The results are summarized in the first figure on the results page
	(see Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_cv_0974_results_summary})
    See steps \ref{sec:predicting_p53_submit} -- \ref{sec:predicting_p53_results_structure_filter}
    of \ref{sec:predicting_p53} for a description of the
    graphical summary output. In this case, there are a lot of putative motif
    hits and it will be difficult to investigate all of these. At this point, it is a good idea
    to limit your search to the most promising candidates first, by trying to remove
    false positive hits.

\item Go back to the ``ELM Predictions'' page (it's probably still open in
    another browser tab) and enter the same values as used before in
	steps~\ref{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_fasta}-\ref{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_cutoff}.
	Now however, in order to reduce false positive hits,
    you should set the ``Motif probability cutoff value'' to a more
	stringent threshold: Enter ``0.001'' for this value. This will exclude
	all motifs with a probability score higher than this, limiting the
	results to motifs which are less likely to be found by random
	chance.

\item Hit \button{Submit} to send the query to the ELM prediction pipeline.
    The results are summarized in the first figure on the results page
	(see Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_cv_0974_results_summary_limited}).
    The amount of motif classes detected has been
    reduced from 54 to 17, and the number of instances from
    156 to 22. Of the remaining 17 motifs, 1 does not occur in
    \textit{Homo sapiens}, 2 do not localize to the cytosol, and 3 are inside
    of the PTPc domain (see the ``Filtering summary'' below the graphical
    result summary).

\item By focussing on motif instances with a high probability
    you have successfully limited the list of ELM motif classes down to 11.
    (Now would be a good point in time to read up on the details of the
    remaining motif classes to get a better idea about which motifs might be
    functional in your protein. Click on the motif identifiers on the left side
    of the graphical summary to go to the details page for the motif classes).
    For this protocol, however, click on the motif identifier
    \motif{LIG\_CSK\_EPIYA\_1} on the left side of the graphical summary to go
    to the details page for this motif class.

\begin{figure}[h!]

	100 (Figure \ref{fig:predicting_cv_0974_results_summary})
	}
	\label{fig:predicting_cv_0974_results_summary_limited}
\end{figure}

\item On the \motif{LIG\_CSK\_EPIYA\_1} details page the ``Functional site description'' states that
	'bacterial proteins usually have repeats of EPIYA motifs.' The ELM
	prediction results did indeed also detect two EPIYA motifs in a 20
	amino acid range (\ref{fig:predicting_cv_0974_results_summary_limited}),
	lending further support to the likelihood that there
	are indeed two functional EPIYA motifs in \uniprot{CV\_0974}, which in
	turn suggests that these motifs may be involved in \textit{C.
	violaceum's} pathogenicity.

    \sdesc{When this motif is tyrosine-phosphorylated it is recognized by C-terminal
    kinase. Different effector proteins from human pathogens like
    \textit{Bartonella henselae}, \textit{Helicobacter pylori} and
    \textit{Haemophilus ducreyi} have been reported to use this motif to
    interfere with the host signalling network to induce proliferation or to
    avoid phagocytosis \citep{19380118, 12446738, 24902122}.
    Also, you may notice that there are no conservation scores for either of
    these motifs. A closer examination of the alignments of homologous
    proteins shows that none of the other proteins have this part of the
    sequence, and are gapped, and it is not possible to calculate a
    conservation score.
    }

\item It is now up to the experimenter to decide whether to undertake
	validation experiments that would confirm the \motif{LIG\_CSK\_EPIYA\_1}
	predictions and function in controlling the host cell. Bioinformatics
	predictions are never certain, and this is especially true for SLiM
	prediction.  At this point it would be important to consult other
	bioinformatics tools and to search literature published after the motif
	was annotated
	(See the \ref{sec:guidelines-for-understanding-results}).

\section{(Alternative Protocol) Searching the ELM database using the REST API}
\label{sec:search_REST}

Many researchers are interested in large-scale analyses rather than
information about individual protein sequences. To this end, individual
queries to the ELM webserver with a single protein ID at a time, are not
practical.

For this reason, as much information as practicable is made available via a
REST interface \citep{Fielding2002}. This allows the user to interact
with the ELM database and ELM webserver via scriptable URL requests.
Each request can easily be tested in the browser before it is being
automated in a script.

In this section we will explore the various ways in which data can be
downloaded both in using the browser as well as via the commandline.

\section{(Alternate Protocol) Detecting Short Linear Motifs in Sequences using the REST API}
\label{sec:predicting_REST}

Querying ELM for motifs in a given sequence (as described in
\ref{sec:predicting_p53} and \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974}), gives you a nice
overview of putative and annotated motifs in your query protein with a
graphical representation
using colors to highlight different regions of the protein sequence (eg.
disordered vs. globular). It is however difficult to analyse a large set
of protein sequences in this manner. Therefore, the ELM server
provides an interface which you can use to submit your sequence in a
programmatic way. Of course, this way, you won't receive the graphical
output representation, but are limited to textual data representation.

Currently, there exists a single URL (\rurl{elm.eu.org/start\_search/})
to accept such queries. You can choose to either submit a UniProt name
or accession (eg. '\url{elm.eu.org/start\_search/P53\_HUMAN.tsv}') or
submit your raw sequence (e.g. '\rurl{elm.eu.org/start\_search/MAPRGFSCLLLLTSEIDLPVKRRA}'.)
If the URL ends in `.tsv' then the server assumes you
are using a UniProt id or accession; if it doesn't, then it assumes you
are using raw sequence. See below for details.

\section*{Guidelines for Understanding Results}
\label{sec:guidelines-for-understanding-results}

The annotations in the ELM database have all been created manually, and in most cases
you can safely assume that the annotations present in the database are of
high confidence.
The annotators have a lot of experience in reading the scientific literature,
and know how to distinguish high confidence from suggestive experiments
\cite{26581338}.
However, bioinformatics databases are never perfect, and some annotations in
ELM may be about 10 years old, so there could be updated literature.
You are also encouraged to dig deeper into each annotation.
In all cases, each entry contains descriptions of the experiments performed and
links to the original research.

Understanding the results generated by the ELM prediction pipeline
can sometimes require some extra work.
In \ref{sec:predicting_p53} and \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974} we gave a few
examples of how to read and interpret the results from the ELM prediction
pipeline.
These are bioinformatics predictions, and therefore will rely
on a heuristic which might make mistakes.
In general the  prediction pipeline attempts to make as many predictions as
possible, at the risk of making some False Positive predictions as well.

All intermediate results generated by the ELM prediction
pipeline are made available to aid you in deciding which predictions are worth
further investigation.
Looking at the multiple sequence alignments used to generate the conservation
score can (for example) help determine why a seemingly likely motif may have a
(falsely) low confidence score.
However, contrary you may have reason to believe that a predicted motif that was
rejected by ELM's structure filter may actually be exposed in a different
structural conformation.
We highly recommend you not to use ELM in isolation. Always make sure to check
the literature and to use other bioinformatics tools to check alignments, structures and conservation (See the \ref{sec:internet-resources-with-annotations} for a handful of suggestions)

\section*{Commentary:}\label{commentary}

\subsection*{Background Information}\label{background-information}

In order to interpret the data contained in ELM and the results produced by the
ELM prediction tool, it is important to have a basic understanding of SLiMs
and how they are affected by their structural and biological context. This
background information summarizes the different functionalities of SLiMs,
describes the degenerate nature of motif sequences, and emphasizes the need for
contextual data for confident SLiM prediction.

\subsubsection*{ELM Categorizes SLiMs Depending on their Functionality}

SLiMs mediate different types of interactions, and based on this functionality,
the ELM classes annotated in the ELM database are grouped into six main ELM
types (Figure~\ref{fig:SLiMclasses}, \cite{24214962}). They can function as ligand binding sites or
as sites for post-translational modification (PTM). Some ligand SLiMs are
recognised by components of the cellular transport machinery and function as
localisation signals that target proteins to specific sub-cellular compartments
(\motif{TRG} type). Other ligand SLiMs are abundantly present in interfaces that mediate
the assembly of large macromolecular complexes and in highly modular scaffold
proteins that act as multivalent platforms for protein complex assembly
(\motif{LIG} type). Docking motifs are ligand SLiMs that recruit modification enzymes to
their substrates by binding to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the
active site (\motif{DOC} type). A subset of these, known as degrons, recruit ubiquitin
ligases, which subsequently polyubiquitylate their substrates and hence target
them for proteasomal degradation (\motif{DEG} type). SLiMs that act as sites for PTM can
be targeted by specific enzymes for the addition or removal of a small chemical
group (e.g. phosphorylation), a sugar molecule (e.g. glycosylation), a protein
(e.g. ubiquitylation), or another moiety (e.g. lipidation) (\motif{MOD} type). Other PTM
SLiMs mediate proteolytic cleavage by acting as target site for proteolytic
enzymes (\motif{CLV} type), or are recognized for structural modification by isomerases
that catalyze cis-trans isomerisation of the peptide backbone (\motif{DOC} type), see
\cite{24926813} and \cite{24773235}.

\subsubsection*{ELM Regular Expressions Reflect the Degenerate Nature of SLiMs}

As their name suggests, SLiMs are compact, being composed of a limited number of
adjacent amino acids. Most of a motif's binding specificity however is conferred
by only a subset of these amino acids. Those few residues that directly interact
with the binding partner are evolutionarily conserved, although in many cases a
subset of amino acids that share certain properties (such as similar charge,
size or hydrophobicity) are allowed in these hotspot positions. In the motif
positions that contribute little to the interaction, there are even less
constraints, i.e. a broader range of amino acids is allowed in these positions
\citep{21909575}. This sequence flexibility is captured in the regular
expressions that are defined for each ELM class. A first consequence of this
degeneracy is that SLiMs co-operatively engage in interactions of relatively low
affinity. Hence these binding events are transient and reversible, and can be
readily modulated, for instance by PTM. These characteristics make SLiM-based
interactions ideal mediators of the dynamic processes involved in cell
signalling \citep{22480932}. Another consequence is that it might take only a few
or even a single point mutation to generate or disrupt a functional motif in a
protein. The associated ability to evolve convergently might underlie the
proliferation of SLiMs and the rewiring of interactomes \citep{26589632,
22346764}. Conversely, several SLiM-associated diseases have been
characterized to date, for instance Liddle syndrome \citep{15483078}.

\subsubsection*{ELM Integrates Data to Increase the Confidence of SLiM Prediction}

Due to their degenerate nature, motif sequences contain only very little
information, and many short sequences in a proteome will match motif patterns.
However, most of these matches will not represent functional motifs, and hence,
scanning a proteome for putative motifs using only the motif sequence
patterns will yield a large number of false positive instances, far exceeding
the number of true motifs.
This is painful both for bioinformaticians and experimentalists.
Therefore, reliable motif detection cannot go without
experimental validation of candidate motifs, using different types of
experiments and techniques \citep{26581338}. This however does not mean that
bioinformatics analysis cannot guide researchers towards a subset of candidate
motifs that have a higher probability to be functional and help rule out those
candidate motifs that are likely to be false positives. Taking into account
additional information, besides a match to a sequence pattern defining a SLiM,
can greatly narrow the selection of putative motifs for experimental validation.
Additional data for \textit{in silico} analysis include conservation of the motif
sequence, the location of the motif within the protein's structure and its
accessibility for its binding partner, validated interaction with the binding
partner, and in-cell co-localisation with the binding partner. The availability
and usefulness of these additional data for SLiM discovery depend on their
extensive and correct biocuration. A vast and increasing amount of biological
data is available in a wide variety of sources, including the literature and
large-scale datasets. In order to facilitate integration of data, they need to
be collected, annotated and formatted in central data and knowledge
repositories. The ELM database provides such a repository for experimentally
validated linear motif classes and instances. The ELM prediction tool in turn
relies on annotated data, both from the ELM database and other resources, to
accurately analyse sequences for candidate motifs and assist researchers
in selecting the most plausible ones for experimental validation and discard
likely false positive hits, saving them valuable time and assets
\citep{22110040}.

\subsubsection*{ELM Filters}

\paragraph*{Disorder Filter}\label{DisorderFilter}

ELM uses two different predictors of globularity/disorder: Firstly, GlobPlot
developed by \cite{12824398}, uses amino acid propensities derived from a set of
proteins to detect regions of globularity/disorder in any given protein
sequence. Secondly, IUPred by \cite{15955779}, which, unlike GlobPlot, has not
been trained on any dataset, but rather uses a position-specific scoring scheme
assessing the tendency of any given amino acid to reside in either an ordered
or disordered region. IUPred assigns a score between 0.0 to 1.0 to each amino
acid of a protein sequence, whereby protein segments with an IUPred score above
0.5 are considered to be disordered. ELM displays IUPred scores as a colored
line on either green (disordered) or red (globular) background, see rows four
and five of Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}.

\paragraph*{Structure Filter}\label{StructureFilter}

The structural filter, especially developed for ELM by \cite{19852836},
assesses accessibility and secondary structural context derived from
experimentally solved protein structures. It maps putatively functional motif
occurrences onto a representative domain structure and scores these motifs for
solvent-accessibility and secondary structure context. ELM displays this
information as overlay boxes in the graphical output, whereby the user needs to
hover over individual instance entries within structural context (see the
\motif{CLV\_PCSK\_SKI1\_1} example in fig.
\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}).

\paragraph*{Conservation Filter}\label{ConservationFilter}

This filter method for scoring the conservation of linear motif instances was
developed by \cite{18460207} and subsequently implemented into the ELM
pipeline. It requires only primary sequence-derived information (e.g. a
multiple alignment and the sequence tree) and implicitly takes into account the
degenerate nature of short linear motif patterns. By auto-generating multiple
sequence alignments from a non-redundant database, generating distance-trees
and taking into account motif degeneracy, it assesses for each ELM motif class
found in any given sequence its conservation. The conservation score ranges
from 0.0 (the predicted instance is present only in the query sequence) to 1.0
(full conservation of the motif regular expression in all the informative
sequences).
In the graphical representation, motif conservation is indicated by coloring
instances in different shades of blue, whereby darker shades of blue represent
higher conservation.
In the case that not enough homologous sequences were detected to build an
alignment, no conservation score can be calculated. Therefore all of the motif
occurrences will be shown in a uniform shade of blue.

Since conserved motifs in structural regions are most likely conserved for
structural integrity rather than motif function, one always has to assess the
context when inspecting conservation score. Generally, the best motif candidates
are those with high conservation scores in unstructured, unconserved
regions.


\paragraph*{Taxon Filter}\label{TaxonFilter}

Each ELM class is annotated with one or more taxonomic ranges, for which
experimental evidence has been found for the particular class
(see "Present in Taxon: Eukaryota" in figure
\ref{fig:explore_content_doc_cyclin}). This information is then used to filter taxons
outside the annotated range whenever a user submits a query sequence to the ELM
database (see the \button{taxonomic context} field in the ELM search input form in fig.
\ref{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}).

\paragraph*{Instance Mapper}\label{InstanceMapper}

The ELM instance mapper takes all annotated instances from the ELM database,
generates a BLAST database from it and uses PHI-BLAST \citep{9705509}
to detect sequence stretches in
the query sequence which are similar to sequences in this database. This allows
the instance mapper to effectively map known instances (for which experimental
evidence exists) onto homologous sequences of unknown function.

Classification of ELM motif classes.
For each ELM class, the functional category to which it belongs is indicated by
a three-letter prefix (such as ``MOD'' for ``MOD\_LATS\_1'').
Each ELM class is defined by a regular expression. Peptide sequences in
proteins that match the regular expression of a specific ELM class and that
were experimentally validated to be functional motifs are captured as ELM
instances of that class.
