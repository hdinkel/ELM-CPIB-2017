\section*{Significance Statement}

TODO: This Significance Statement could also use some suggestions :) (Max 120
words). - Marc 

Short Linear motifs (SLiMs) are small protein-interaction modules that play
essential roles in signalling, cell cycle, trafficking and disease.
SLiMs are short, degenerate sequences with no stable
secondary structure, and have proven difficult to study both experimentally
and computationally.
The number of different motifs is believed to be in the order of millions.
Yet, despite their abundance and importance, we have a limited
understanding of which motifs exist and their function.
The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource is an online database containing
over 3000 manually curated SLiMs from experimental
literature, and a pipeline to detect SLiMs in protein sequences.
ELM is a valuable resource to the scientific community studying protein
function.

% \emph{instructions: Provide a 120-word-maximum statement about the

% should be understandable to undergraduate- educated scientists outside
% their field of specialty. The goal is to explain the relevance of the

The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource (\rurl{elm.eu.org}) dedicated to the
characterization and prediction of short linear motifs (SLiMs).
SLiMs are small degenerate peptide segments found in all proteins and
essential to all cellular processes which, despite their abundance, still remain
largely uncharacterized.

The ELM database is a collection of manually annotated SLiM instances curated
from experimental literature.

In this article we explore how to browse and search the database curated SLiM
data, and cover the different types of data integrated in the resource. 

We also cover how to use this resource in order to predict SLiMs motifs in
known as well as unknown proteins, and how to interpret the
results generated by the ELM prediction pipeline.

The ELM database is a very rich resource, and in the following
protocols we give helpful examples of how this knowledge can be used to
improve your own research.

% Introduction
\section*{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

The activity and function of a protein is tightly regulated by its
cellular environment. To interact with their surroundings, proteins use
various types of binding modules that each display distinct binding
properties \citep{10550212}. One prominent type of binding module
consists of short linear motifs (SLiMs) \citep{18508681}. These compact
binding sites are generally located in intrinsically disordered regions
(IDR) of the proteome and commonly bind to
surfaces of a globular domain of a protein \citep{21909575}. SLiMs mediate
different types of interactions that regulate protein functionality, and hence
are important regulators of the dynamic processes involved in cell
signalling \citep{22480932} \citep{24926813}. The number of
SLiM instances in the human proteome is currently suggested to be over
one million \citep{25038412}. Identifying SLiMs and elucidating their
functionality is an essential step in understanding cell regulation. The
Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource contributes to this process by
providing the necessary tools to researchers working on motifs. It
consists of a database and a prediction tool. The database provides a
categorised repository of experimentally validated linear motif classes
and instances that were manually annotated from the literature. The ELM
prediction tool in turn relies on annotated data, both from the ELM
database and other resources, to accurately analyse unknown sequences
for candidate motifs and assist researchers in selecting the most
plausible ones for experimental validation and discard likely false
positive hits, saving them valuable time and resources \citep{22110040}.
The following protocols will guide users through the different ELM
applications, explaining how to browse the curated data available in
ELM, how to analyse a protein sequence for putative motifs, and how to
interpret these data and avoid common pitfalls in SLiM discovery.

\section{Exploring the Content of the ELM Database}%
\label{sec:explore_content}%

% TODO: this paragraph is technically not part of the protocol but rather introduction
% I think this part is OK here: It introduces the annotated part of the database.
% Also, I think we can 'assume' that most Papers will be read from top to bottom?
The core of the ELM database is a repository of manually annotated motifs and
instances. As of January 2017, ELM contains over 260 motif classes and over
3000 experimentally validated and manually curated instances.
The motif classes and motif instances have been uploaded by a large group of
annotators from around the globe. The complete catalogue of manually curated
data can be searched, browsed and explored on the ELM website.

% TODO: this paragraph is technically not part of the protocol but rather introduction
% This part: agreed, if we can find a way to put it in the introduction.
% Although I don't think its too bad here :)
Each motif class describes a short linear motif, a short sequence of amino acids
with a dedicated function. Since the motifs are often degenerate, each motif
class is represented using ``regular expressions'': a symbolic representation
expressing a complex pattern of letters (or amino acids). For example, the
regular expression ``\motif{[FY].L.P}'' is to be read as: The first amino acid
is a Phenylalaline '\motif{F}' or a Tyrosine '\motif{Y}' followed by any one
amino acid '\motif{.}', a Leucine '\motif{L}', one more arbitrary amino acid
'\motif{.}' and finally a Proline '\motif{P}'.

% TODO: this paragraph is technically not part of the protocol but rather introduction
% I also think this part is a nice part for the introduction to this section
% (annotated data)
In all cases the annotator condenses information from the primary and secondary
literature into manageable abstracts, accompanies the motif definition with
a list of experimental instances, as well as links to external resources including
biological pathways, diseases, Gene Ontology and other protein resources. In
this protocol we explore the several data-types stored in the database, as well
as links to external resources.

\section{Exploring the Content of the ELM Database Using the General Search}
\label{sec:general_search}

A general search text box is available to query the entire collection of
manually curated information in the ELM database. This search field can be found in the header
of the ELM database website (see for example Fig.
\ref{fig:general_search_TP53_instances}). This search peforms a full-text
query across multiple selected data sources in the ELM database, including
ELM classes, instances, candidates, and switches. Using this general search is helpful in
getting information about a particular protein and its annotation status in the ELM database
(eg. full instance vs. candidate).

\section{Detecting Short Linear Motifs in Protein Sequences}
\label{sec:predicting_p53}

One of the most useful (and used) features in ELM is the ability to
detect motifs in proteins and sequences. Given a protein's amino acid
sequence, the ``ELM Predictions'' pipeline searches for occurrences of
each motif class using regular expressions, applies a set of filters to
minimize false positives and creates a diagram to visualize the resulting
set of putative motifs.

In this protocol we will be viewing the manually annotated data of a
typical protein, using p53 (UniProt ID: \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN}/P04637) as an
example. We will cover how to find the manually annotated motifs and instances,
the references used to annotate each
instance, the experimental protocols used, and additional information including
relationships to biological pathways (KEGG), diseases (OMIM) and molecular
switches (switches.ELM).

\end{figure}

\item Open a browser, and navigate to the ELM homepage: \url{http://elm.eu.org}.\label{sec:predicting_p53_elm_search}
	Enter the UniProt ID \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} in the search field labelled
	``Enter a UniProt identifier or accession number''. While typing, the page should
	autocomplete your input ``\uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} / P04637 (\textit{Homo
	sapiens})'' and already pre-fill other fields of the input form (Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}).
	Click on this entry to confirm that you want to search for
	motifs in this protein. Click on \button{Submit} to send the query to
	the server.

	\sdesc{The autocompletion mechanism queries UniProt for the given protein
		identifier; if it succeeds, then additional information from
		UniProt will be used to auto-populate the input boxes. In this
		example, \uniprot{P53\_HUMAN} is recognized as a human protein,
		and so ``Homo sapiens'' is automatically filled in the
		``Taxonomic Context'' field. Also, p53 has been annotated (by
		UniProt) to be localized to nucleus, cytosol, endoplasmic
		reticulum and mitochondrion, so these are also automatically
		applied as search criteria. The motif cutoff of ``100'' is a
		sufficiently high (lenient) threshold to ensure no motif class
		is filtered out based on motif probability.}

\item Select the search criteria (optional). 
%	It is possible to limit the results by ``Cell compartment'', ``Taxonomic Context'' or by changing the ``Motif Probability Cutoff''.
	To restrict the search to include
	motifs that are active only in certain cellular compartments, select one or
	more from the ``Cell compartment'' list (use the ``control'' key to select more than one
	option). It is also possible to select a ``Taxonomic Context'' to
	restrict the search to motifs from certain species. Start typing a
	species name in the ``Taxonomic Context'' input field to get an
	auto-completed list of species to select from. Additionally, a ``Motif
	probability cutoff'' can be used to only retain ELM classes whose
	pattern probability is below the given value.
	These filters are implemented later in \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974}).
	For now, leave all filters at the default values that were
	auto-populated for p53.

\item \label{sec:predicting_p53_results_phosphorylation} The first row contains phosphorylation sites, as retrieved from
	PhosphoELM \citep{21062810}, and shows whether the phosphorylated amino
	acid is a serine, threonine or tyrosine. PhosphoELM is a database of
	manually annotated phosphorylation sites, obtained from scientific
	publications from low and high-throughput experiments. You can follow
	the link to PhosphoELM by clicking on the phosphorylation site in the
	image to get more information on individual phosphorylation sites.

	\sdesc{Phosphorylation sites are only available when the search is

\item The second row shows SMART and PFAM domains detected by the SMART
	database \citep{9600884, 25300481, 9600884}
	(Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}). Hover the
	mouse over these domains to see their names and exact start and end
	positions.

	\sdesc{In order to be functional, motifs need to be accessible, and
		therefore they are usually not found within globular domains
		or structured regions \citep{21909575}. Any motif detected
		by the ELM prediction pipeline inside of a SMART domain are
		less likely to be functional, and therefore are shown with a gray box
		background (see commentary section "Structure Filter" at page \pageref{StructureFilter}).}

\item The third row shows globular and disordered regions in the
	sequence, as predicted by GlobPlot \citep{12824398}. The fourth
	and fifth rows
	contain results from IUPred \citep{15955779}, another
	predictor of disordered protein regions. Protein segments with
	an IUPred score above 0.5 are considered to be disordered
	(see commentary section "Disorder Filter" at page \pageref{DisorderFilter}).

	\sdesc{Motifs are typically only functional when found in intrinsically
		disordered regions. Any motif occurrence detected by the ELM
		prediction pipeline that falls within disordered regions are
		more likely to be functional.}

\item The 5th row (Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}) contains
	information on the protein's structure (see commentary section "Structure Filter" at page \pageref{StructureFilter}). 
	The secondary structure is
	predicted by mapping the motif occurrence onto high quality
	reference domain structures \citep{19852836}. Check the graphical
	representation, and whether the output of the secondary structure filter and
	the disorder predictors agree with each other with respect to which parts of the
	sequence are considered structured or disordered.

\item The remainder of the figure (below ``secondary structure'' output)
	displays predicted and annotated motif instances, overlayed with the
	structural context from rows 2 and 3 (SMART domains and GlobPlot). A
	blue square indicates a single motif occurrence, and intensity of the
	color indicates the conservation of this sequence across a group of
	homologous proteins.
	Boxes in gray are motif occurrences that have been filtered out by the
	structure filter. Boxes that are blue \& gray are neutral:
	Within a globular domain, however part of a loop
	according to the secondary structure predictions.
	 If the sequence is already present in the ELM database,
	any motif instances that have already been annotated are shown as
	ovals. Lastly, any motifs detected that are annotated to be
	functional in homologous sequences, are shown as red \& blue
	rectangles (see commentary section "Instance Mapper" at page \pageref{InstanceMapper}).

	\sdesc{ In the case that not enough homologous sequences were detected
		to build an alignment, no conservation score can be calculated.
		Therefore all of the motif occurrences will be shown in a
		uniform shade of blue. }

\item Place the cursor over the blue box for motif occurrence
	\motif{CLV\_C14\_Caspase3-7} at the end of the sequence (
	position 388--392). This will trigger the green and yellow
	information screen shown on the top right in Fig.
	\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}.
	This motif is in a disordered region, and has not been
	filtered out by the structural filter. Also, its conservation score
	of 0.910 is very high, indicating that this motif is highly conserved.

	\sdesc{The conservation score is based on how conserved the sequence is
		across a set of homologous proteins
		(see commentary section "Conservation Filter" at page \pageref{ConservationFilter}).}

\item \label{sec:predicting_p53_results_structure_filter} Place the cursor over the blue \& gray rectangle for motif
	\motif{CLV\_Separin\_Metazoa} at position 171--175, a motif
	which was flagged as ``neutral'' by the ELM prediction pipeline.
	This will trigger the information screen (with the pink header) shown
	in Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary} to appear.
	This motif resides inside the p53 PFAM domain, and thus has been
	subjected to ``structural filtering''. However, the secondary structure
	prediction suggests that this motif occurs within the looped region of this
	domain, so may be accessible.

	\sdesc{The information screen pop-up
	shows scores for all of the individual criteria used by the secondary
	structure filter: The name of the domain, the accessibility
	score, secondary structure score, a combined total score,
	and the associated total score P-value \citep{19852836}.}

\item Place the cursor over the red oval for \motif{DEG\_MDM2\_SWIB\_1} at
	position 19--26. This motif is an annotated instance in the
	ELM database, and is therefore a bona-fide experimentally validated
	instance.

%%% Predicting with CV_0974
\section{Detecting Short Linear Motifs in Novel Protein Sequences}
\label{sec:predicting_cv_0974}

% TODO: read this section to check for consistency, etc.

The ELM motif detection pipeline is a very powerful way to obtain a lot of
information on which motifs are present, in which structural context they
are. However, determining which motifs are actually true positive detections
requires interpreting all of these results, as well as incorporating as much
biological knowledge as possible. In this protocol we will be following a
typical example of how one might use the ELM pipeline to search for
motifs in novel sequences.

% TODO: this might need to go into commentary section:
Some pathogens have evolved short linear motifs in effector proteins to modify
the intracellular signalling of their host cell for their own convenience
\citep{25475989}. The Gram-negative bacteria \textit{Chromobacterium violaceum} is a
opportunistic pathogen of humans whose mechanism of pathogenicity remain poorly
understood. Its genome encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) that is
used by different pathogens to translocate bacterial proteins into the infected cells.
Interestingly, the genes encoding this T3SS as well as other genes located in
the same genomic location are very similar to the ones in \textit{Salmonella spp.},
except for a couple of genes including the modular protein SptP
\citep{15100995}. SptP in \textit{Salmonella spp.} is a secreted protein tyrosine
phosphatase \citep{8866485} whose closest homolog in \textit{C. violaceum} is
the protein \uniprot{CV\_0974}. To further understand the possible biological
function of the protein \uniprot{CV\_0974} we will use it as an example
application of the ELM server motif detection pipeline.

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_fasta} Click on the ``ELM Predictions'' button in the menu to access the search
	query page (Fig. \ref{fig:predicting_cv_0974_search}).
	Here you should provide the amino acid sequence of \uniprot{CV\_0974}
	from UniProt (\url{http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7NZE8.fasta}), and
	enter it as FASTA format into the ``sequence input text box''.

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_taxon} In the ``Taxonomic Context'' field, enter the text ``Homo

	which have been annotated for human proteins.

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_compartment} The bacterial protein \uniprot{CV\_0974} is likely to be an effector protein, similarly to its

    field.

\item \label{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_cutoff} For now, you should set

\item Hit \button{Submit} to send the query to the ELM prediction pipeline.
    The results are summarized in the first figure on the results page

    See steps \ref{sec:predicting_p53_submit} -- \ref{sec:predicting_p53_results_structure_filter}
    of \ref{sec:predicting_p53} for a description of the
    graphical summary output. In this case, there are a lot of putative motif
    hits and it will be difficult to investigate all of these. So you should try
    to limit your search to most promising candidates first, by trying to remove
    false positive hits.

\item Go back to the ``ELM Predictions'' page (it's probably still open in
    another browser tab) and enter the same values as used before in
	steps~\ref{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_fasta}-\ref{subsec:predicting_cv_0974_search_cutoff}.
	Now however, in order to remove false positive hits,
    you should set the ``Motif probability cutoff value'' to a more
	stringent threshold. Enter ``0.001'' for this value. This will exclude
	all motif with a probability score higher than this, limiting the
	results to motifs which are less likely to be found by random
	chance (False Positives).

    You notice the amount of motif classes detected has been

\item Find the entry for \motif{LIG\_CSK\_EPIYA\_1} in the graphical summary

%%% Searching via REST API
\section{(Alternative Protocol) Searching the ELM database using the REST API}
\label{sec:search_REST}

Many researchers are interested in large-scale analyses rather than
information about individual protein sequences. To this end, individual
queries to the ELM webserver with a single protein ID at a time, are not
practical.

For this reason, as much information as practicable is made available via a
REST interface \citep{Fielding2002}. This allows the user to interact
with the ELM database and ELM webserver via scriptable URL requests.
Each request can easily be tested in the browser before it is being
automated in a script.

In this section we will explore the various ways in which data can be
downloaded both in using the browser as well as via the commandline.

%%% Predicting via REST API
\section{(Alternate Protocol) Detecting Short Linear Motifs in Sequences using the REST API}
\label{sec:predicting_REST}

Querying ELM for motifs in a given sequence (as described in
\ref{sec:predicting_p53} and \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974}), gives you a nice
overview of putative and annotated motifs in your query protein with a
graphical representation
using colors to highlight different regions of the protein sequence (eg.
disordered vs. globular). It is however difficult to analyse a large set
of protein sequences in this manner. Therefore, the ELM server
provides an interface which you can use to submit your sequence in a
programmatic way. Of course, this way, you won't receive the graphical
output representation, but are limited to textual data representation.

Currently, there exists a single URL (\rurl{elm.eu.org/start\_search/})
to accept such queries. You can choose to either submit a UniProt name
or accession (eg. '\url{elm.eu.org/start\_search/P53\_HUMAN.tsv}') or
submit your raw sequence (e.g. '\rurl{elm.eu.org/start\_search/MAPRGFSCLLLLTSEIDLPVKRRA}'.)
If the URL ends in `.tsv' then the server assumes you
are using a UniProt id or accession; if it doesn't, then it assumes you
are using raw sequence. See below for details.

%%% Commentary
\section*{Guidelines for Understanding Results}
\label{sec:guidelines-for-understanding-results}

TODO: Does anyone want to edit this section? It still might be missing things? -Marc

The annotations in the ELM database have all been created manually, and in most cases
you can safely assume that the annotations present in the database are of
high confidence.
These annotators have a lot of experience in reading the scientific literature,
and know how to distinguish high confidence from suggestive experiments
\cite{26581338}.
However, bioinformatics databases are never perfect, and some annotations in
ELM may be ~10 years old, so there could be updated literature.
You are also encouraged to dig deeper into each annotation.
In all cases, each entry contains descriptions of the experiments performed and
links to the original research.

Understanding the results generated by the ELM prediction pipeline 
can sometimes require some extra work.
In \ref{sec:predicting_p53} and \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974} we gave a few
examples of how to read and interpret the results from the ELM prediction
pipeline.
These are bioinformatics predictions, and therefore will rely
on a heuristic which might make mistakes.
In general the  prediction pipeline attempts to make as many predictions as
possible, at the risk of making some False Positive predictions as well.

In cases all of the intermediate results generated by the ELM prediction
pipeline are made available to aid you in deciding which predictions are worth
further investigation.
Looking at the multiple sequence alignments used to generate the conservation
score can (for example) help determine why a seemingly likely motif may have a
(falsely) low confidence score.
However, contrary you may have reason to believe that a predicted motif that was
rejected by ELM's structure filter may actually exposed in a different
structural conformation.
We highly recommend you do not use ELM in isolation. Always make sure to check
the literature and to use other bioinformatics tools to check alignments, structures and conservation (See the \ref{sec:internet-resources-with-annotations} for a handful of suggestions)

\section*{Commentary:}\label{commentary}

\emph{instructions: A brief discussion of the theory and applications of
your}

\subsection*{Background Information}\label{background-information}

In order to interpret the data contained in ELM and the results produced by the
ELM prediction tool, it is important to have a basic understanding of SLiM's
and how they are affected by their structural and biological context. This
background information summarises the different functionalities of SLiMs,
describes the degenerate nature of motif sequences, and emphasises the need for
contextual data for confident SLiM prediction.

\subsubsection*{ELM categorises SLiMs depending on their functionality}

SLiMs mediate different types of interactions, and based on this functionality,
the ELM classes annotated in the ELM database are grouped into six main ELM
types (Figure~\ref{fig:SLiMclasses}, \cite{24214962}). They can function as ligand binding sites or
as sites for post-translational modification (PTM). Some ligand SLiMs are
recognised by components of the cellular transport machinery and function as
localisation signals that target proteins to specific sub-cellular compartments
(\motif{TRG} type). Other ligand SLiMs are abundantly present in interfaces that mediate
the assembly of large macromolecular complexes and in highly modular scaffold
proteins that act as multivalent platforms for protein complex assembly
(\motif{LIG} type). Docking motifs are ligand SLiMs that recruit modification enzymes to
their substrates by binding to a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the
active site (\motif{DOC} type). A subset of these, known as degrons, recruit ubiquitin
ligases, which subsequently polyubiquitylate their substrates and hence target
them for proteasomal degradation (\motif{DEG} type). SLiMs that act as sites for PTM can
be targeted by specific enzymes for the addition or removal of a small chemical
group (e.g. phosphorylation), a sugar molecule (e.g. glycosylation), a protein
(e.g. ubiquitylation), or another moiety (e.g. lipidation) (\motif{MOD} type). Other PTM
SLiMs mediate proteolytic cleavage by acting as target site for proteolytic
enzymes (\motif{CLV} type), or are recognised for structural modification by isomerases
that catalyse cis-trans isomerisation of the peptide backbone (\motif{DOC} type), see
\cite{24926813} and \cite{24773235}.

\subsubsection*{ELM regular expressions reflect the degenerate nature of SLiMs}

As their name suggests, SLiMs are compact, being composed of a limited number of
adjacent amino acids. Most of a motif's binding specificity however is conferred
by only a subset of these amino acids. Those few residues that directly interact
with the binding partner are evolutionarily conserved, although in many cases a
subset of amino acids that share certain properties (such as similar charge,
size or hydrophobicity) are allowed in these hotspot positions. In the motif
positions that contribute little to the interaction, there are even less
constraints, i.e. a broader range of amino acids is allowed in these positions
\citep{21909575}. This sequence flexibility is captured in the regular
expressions that are defined for each motif class. A first consequence of this
degeneracy is that SLiMs co-operatively engage in interactions of relatively low
affinity. Hence these binding events are transient and reversible, and can be
readily modulated, for instance by PTM. These characteristics make SLiM-based
interactions ideal mediators of the dynamic processes involved in cell
signalling \citep{22480932}. Another consequence is that it might take only a few
or even a single point mutation to generate or disrupt a functional motif in a
protein. The associated ability to evolve convergently might underlie the
proliferation of SLiMs and the rewiring of interactomes \citep{26589632,
22346764}. Conversely, several SLiM-associated diseases have been
characterised to date, for instance Liddle syndrome \citep{15483078}.

\subsubsection*{ELM integrates data to increase the confidence of SLiM prediction}

Due to their degenerate nature, motif sequences contain only very little
information, and many short sequences in a proteome will match motif patterns.
However, most of these matches will not represent functional motifs, and hence,
when scanning a proteome for putative motifs using only the motif sequence
patterns will yield a large number of false positive instances, far exceeding
the number of true motifs.
This is painful both for bioinformaticians and experimentalists.
Therefore, reliable motif detection cannot go without
experimental validation of candidate motifs, using different types of
experiments and techniques \citep{26581338}. This however does not mean that
bioinformatics analysis cannot guide researchers towards a subset of candidate
motifs that have a higher probability to be functional and help rule out those
candidate motifs that are likely to be false positives. Taking into account
additional information, besides a match to a sequence pattern defining a SLiM,
can greatly narrow the selection of putative motifs for experimental validation.
Additional data for in silico analysis include conservation of the motif
sequence, the location of the motif within the protein's structure and its
accessibility for its binding partner, validated interaction with the binding
partner, and in-cell co-localisation with the binding partner. The availability
and usefulness of these additional data for SLiM discovery depends on their
extensive and correct biocuration. A vast and increasing amount of biological
data is available in a wide variety of sources, including the literature and
large-scale datasets. In order to facilitate integration of data, they need to
be collected, annotated and formatted in central data and knowledge
repositories. The ELM database provides such a repository for experimentally
validated linear motif classes and instances. The ELM prediction tool in turn
relies on annotated data, both from the ELM database and other resources, to
accurately analyse unknown sequences for candidate motifs and assist researchers
in selecting the most plausible ones for experimental validation and discard
likely false positive hits, saving them valuable time and assets
\citep{22110040}.

\subsubsection*{ELM Filters}

\paragraph*{Disorder Filter}\label{DisorderFilter}

ELM uses two different predictors of globularity/disorder: Firstly, GlobPlot
developed by \cite{12824398}, uses amino acid propensities derived from a set of
proteins to detect regions of globularity/disorder in any given protein
sequence. Secondly, IUPred by \cite{15955779}, which, unlike GlobPlot, has not
been trained on any dataset, but rather uses a position-specific scoring scheme
assessing the tendency of any given amino acid to reside in either an ordered
or disordered region. IUPred assigns a score between 0.0 to 1.0 to each amino
acid of a protein sequence, whereby protein segments with an IUPred score above
0.5 are considered to be disordered. ELM displays IUPred scores as a colored
line on either green (disordered) or red (globular) background, see rows four
and five of Figure~\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}.

\paragraph*{Structure Filter}\label{StructureFilter}

The structural filter, especially developed for ELM by \cite{19852836},
assesses accessibility and secondary structural context derived from
experimentally solved protein structures. It maps putatively functional motif
occurrences onto a representative domain structure and scores these motifs for
solvent-accessibility and secondary structure context. ELM displays this
information as overlay boxes in the graphical output, whereby the user needs to
hover over individual instance entries within structural context (see the
\motif{CLV\_PCSK\_SKI1\_1} example in fig.
\ref{fig:predicting_p53_results_summary}).

\paragraph*{Conservation Filter}\label{ConservationFilter}

This filter method for scoring the conservation of linear motif instances was
developed by \cite{18460207} and subsequently implemented into the ELM
pipeline. It requires only primary sequence-derived information (e.g. a
multiple alignment and the sequence tree) and implicitly takes into account the
degenerate nature of short linear motif patterns. By auto-generating multiple
sequence alignments from a non-redundant database, generating distance-trees
and taking into account motif degeneracy, it assesses for each ELM motif class
found in any given sequence its conservation. The conservation score ranges
from 0.0 (the predicted instance is present only in the query sequence) to 1.0
(full conservation of the motif regular expression in all the informative
sequences).
In the graphical representation, motif conservation is indicated by coloring
instances in different shades of blue, whereby darker shades of blue represent
higher conservation.
In the case that not enough homologous sequences were detected to build an
alignment, no conservation score can be calculated. Therefore all of the motif
occurrences will be shown in a uniform shade of blue.

Since conserved motifs in structural regions are most likely conserved for
structural integrity rather than motif function, one always has to assess the
context when inspecting conservation score. Generally, best motif candidates
are those with high conservation scores in regions of unstructured, unconserved
regions.

% Further generalizing, taking into

\paragraph*{Taxon Filter}\label{TaxonFilter}

Each ELM class is annotated with one or more taxonomic ranges, for which
experimental evidence has been found for the particular class
(see "Present in Taxon: Eukaryota" in figure
\ref{fig:explore_content_doc_cyclin}). This information is then used to filter taxons
outside the annotated range whenever a user submits a query sequence to the ELM
database (see the \button{taxonomic context} field in the ELM search input form in fig.
\ref{fig:predicting_p53_elm_search}).

\paragraph*{Instance Mapper}\label{InstanceMapper}

The ELM instance mapper takes all annotated instances from the ELM database,
generates a BLAST database from it and uses PHI-BLAST
to detect sequence stretches in
the query sequence which are similar to sequences in this database \citep{9705509}. This allows
the instance mapper to effectively map known instances (for which experimental
evidence exists) onto homologous sequences of unknown function.

Each ELM class is defined by a regular expression. Peptide sequences in
proteins that match the regular expression of a specific ELM class and that

instances of that class. Degrons are a specific subtype of enzyme-recruiting
