\f0\fs24 \cf0 Figure 1: functional classification of SLiMs. For each ELM class, the functional category to which it belongs is indicated by a three-letter prefix. Each ELM class is defined by a regular expression. Peptide sequences in proteins that match the regular expression of a specific ELM class and that were experimentally validated to be functional motifs are captured as ELM instances of that class. Degrons are a specific subtype of enzyme-recruiting docking motifs (see text for a detailed description).}
