# Basic protocol 2: Explore the content of the ELM DB

step 1. Go to the http://elm.eu.org and click on the tab ELM DB to explore the
content of the different types of data about experimentally validated ELM which
are manually curated from the literature (Figure 1).

**Figure 1**


step 2. Summary of the ELM classes (Figure 2). For each class the
following information are provided: ELM identifier, short description,
regular expression, number of instance annotated for each class, and
number of structure available. For details on each class, click on the ELM
identifier

step 3. ELM instance. Some filters (instance logic, organism and ELM class) can
be applied to retrieve  the instance of interest (Figure 3)

step 4. Table of the methods used for the ELM annotation. The methods are
provided by the  PsiMi (Proteomics Standards Initiative - Molecular
Interaction)  (Figure 4)

step 5. Table of the structures linked to an ELM instance (Figure 5)

step 6. Table of the binding domains (Figure 6)

step 7. Table of the ELM switches (Figure 7)

step 8. List of pathways from the "Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes" (KEGG) database mapped to ELM instance (Fig 8)
Are the pathways described elsewhere? Otherwise, I could extend this section

step 9. Table of the ELM instance abused by viruses (Fig 9)

step 10. Short description of disease caused by mutation reported in ELM instances. (Fig 10)
