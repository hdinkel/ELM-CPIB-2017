Ideally use \code{curl} \rurl{curl.haxx.se/} on the commandline. This
program can be launched from the terminal in any of the major operating
systems: OSX, Windows and Linux. Of course \code{curl} is only one of
many different ways to access web content programatically, and we
suggest anyone to use which ever program they feel is better suited for
their tasks.
