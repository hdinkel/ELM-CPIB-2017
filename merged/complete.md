The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource (http://elm.eu.org) is a manually curated database of short linear motifs (SLiMs).
This protocol explains how to best use this resource and explains 
how to access the database content (both manual and scripted access),
how to interpret the output,
and how to predict novel putative motifs in any given protein sequence.

# Introduction

*Needs a lot of re-writing!*

Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) a short protein-interaction modules that determine
how a protein functions any play major roles all processes that occur in a cell.
(REFS 3-6 from 2016 NAR paper?)
Recent estimates suggest that they may be anywhere in the order of millions of
different motifs (\cite{25038412}), each with different functions and specificities.
Understanding and identifying which motifs exist, and what their biological
functions are will be essential to understanding how every single protein
performs its biological functions in the cell. Being able to detect motifs in
novel proteins will also greatly help the in silico prediction of protein
function.
The ELM database represents the first attempt an creating a single repository
of SLiM's, their functional roles, and their occurrences. 

SLiMs are generally located in intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) of the
proteome, but often adapt a secondary structure upon binding (\cite{19841628}).
In general, they bind to the surface of a globular domain in a protein,
although some are known to bind to a protein’s IDR or even RNA molecules. As
their name suggests, SLiMs are short, typically between 3 and 11 amino acids,
and specificity is usually conferred by only a subset of these. 
Due to their degenerate nature, motif sequences contain only very little
information, and many short sequences in a any given protein will match motif patterns.
However, most of these matches will not represent functional motifs,
Additional data for in silico analysis include conservation of the motif
sequence, the location of the motif within the protein’s structure and its
accessibility for its binding partner, validated interaction with the binding
partner, and in-cell co-localisation with the binding partner. The availability
and usefulness of these additional data for SLiM discovery depends on their
extensive and correct biocuration. A vast and increasing amount of biological
data is available in a wide variety of sources, including the literature and
large-scale datasets. 
In order to facilitate integration of data, they need to be collected,
annotated and formatted in central data and knowledge repositories.

The ELM database is a repository for experimentally validated linear motif classes and instances. 
The web resource (elm.eu.org) provides a
web interface to search and browse these data, as well as a prediction tool to
detect these motifs in novel sequences. In the first Protocol we explain how to
browse the database of manually curated SLiMs and the collection of annotated
motif instances, including information on the experimental protocols contained
in ELM and links to known tertiary structures, diseases, biological pathways,
and molecular switches. In the second protocol we take P53 as an example to
shown how to interpret the motif annotations for a single protein, including
information on how to determine which experimental protocols and literature
citations were used for each instance annotation.  The 3 protocol (an
alternative protocol) briefly describes how to use the "global search" feature
of ELM. The third and fourth protocols show examples of how to use the manually
curated dataset in ELM to detect the occurrences of motifs in novel sequences.
Basic protocol 3 shows how to submit a novel sequence to the database, and how
to read and interpret the results yielded by the ELM Prediction pipeline. The
last Protocol (Alternate protocol 2) shows how to access ELM programmatically via
the API.

# Basic protocol 1: Explore the content of the ELM DB

The core of the ELM database is a repository of manually annotated motifs and
instances. As of December 2016, ELM contains over 260 motif classes categorized
into 6 different types: DOC (docking), LIG (Ligand binding), DEG (degradation),
CLV (cleavage), MOD (post translational modifications), and TRG
(targeting/anchoring) motifs (Figure functional_classification_of_SLiMs). These
motifs are derived from various types of experiments reported in literature.
Each manually annotated motif also has a set of bona fide instances
(occurrences) of this motif. Currently, there are over 3000 annotated instances
annotated from over 2500 publications. The motif classes and motif instances
have been uploaded by a large group of annotators from around the globe. The
complete catalogue of manually curated data can be searched, browsed and
explored on the ELM website

## Database content overview

![](../Figures/TP53_2/stats.png)
**Figure TP53-BP2-1** The ELM database overview page (http://elm.eu.org/search.db).

Step 1. Go to http://elm.eu.org and click on the tab "ELM DB" to explore the
content of the different types of data about experimentally validated ELMs that
were manually curated from the literature (Figure TP53-BP2-1). This page
contains a brief summary of the database content, as well as the number of
links to third-party databases. The table gives an overview of the type and
amount of information stored in the database. Each line contains at least one
link which will take you to the corresponding contents page (eg. “ELM instances”).

![](../Figures/TP53_2/elms.png)
**Figure TP53-BP2-2** The list of all motifs in the ELM database.

Step 2. Click on the sub-menu "ELM classes" in "ELM DB" to see the page with all
of the ELM classes (Figure TP53-BP2-2). For each class, the following
information is provided: ELM identifier, short description, regular
expression, number of instances annotated for each class, and number of
structures available. For details on each class, click on the ELM
identifier; to get a list of annotated instances for an individual class,
click on the number of instances.

> Use the search bar at the top of the page to filter for certain motif
> classes. For example, typing "MAPK" and hitting submit will perform a
> full-text search on all motif classes in the ELM database containing the term "MAPK".
> The green buttons on the left can also be used to filter this
> table. For example, toggling the "DOC" button will remove all "DOC" classes
> from the table (and clicking it again will bring them back). Lastly, the
> yellow tsv link can be used to export all motif classes as a "tab separated
> values" file.

![](../Figures/TP53_1/doc_cyclin_1_class.png)
**Figure TP53-BP1- 4** The motif details page for "DOC_CYCLIN_1". This page
contains all of the manual annotation details for the DOC_CYCLIN_1 motif,
the biological background summarized from the scientific literature including
links to the primary literature and to external resources (Pubmed (\cite{27899561}),
GeneOntology (\cite{27899567}), PDB (\cite{12037327}) and more).

Step 3.  Search the table for the term "DOC_CYCLIN_1" and click on its link to
navigate to the page with details about the "DOC_CYCLIN_1" motif class (Fig
TP53-BP1-4). This page contains a description of the functional site class (a
Cyclin recognition site), and a short description of the ELM and its regular
expression, as well as a probability score, the taxonomic distribution of the
motif and which domain (if any) is responsible for the interaction.

> The probability score is the probability that the regular expression
> represents a random selection of amino acids (similar to an information
> content score). A lower score indicates that the motif pattern is more
> difficult to find by chance in a random sequence.

Step 4. Scroll further down the "DOC_CYCLIN_1" page (Fig TP53-BP1-5) to view
more details about the manually annotated data and instances in the database
(to the text box starting with the "Abstract"). The "abstract" contains a more
detailed description of the motif annotation. Click on the "Show" button next
to the "selected references" header for a list of publications relevant to this
motif. Click on "Show" next to "GO terms" for a complete list of all GO terms
annotated for this motif.

Step 5. Scroll further down the "DOC_CYCLIN_1" page (Fig TP53-BP1-5) to view
the "Instances" header. This table contains the list of all annotated
instances in the database of this motif. This includes the protein identifier,
the start and end positions of the instance, the specific sequence matching the
regular expression and the logic of the instance. The "# Ev." indicates the
number of experimental evidences associated with the annotation (see section
XXX below). Organism is the species in which the protein is found. Lastly the
"Notes" column contains links to any "interactions" or "switches" present in the
database, as well as links to PDB if this structure exists in PDB.

instance found in P53 with start/end position "30-35".

Step 10. Repeat the previous search by clicking on the sub-menu "ELM instances"
in "ELM DB" and type “p53_human” in the search box. This time, try to find the
ELM instance "DOC_WW_Pin1_4" motif with the start/end position "30-35" (You can
sort the table by clicking on the header lines eg. on “Start” to sort by
startposition ). Click on the start/endposition or the subsequence which will
take you to the details page as shown in Fig TP53-BP1-6. This page is similar
to that described for the P53 instance "DOC_CYCLIN_1" (Fig TP53-BP1-5);
additionally, for this instance there is information available about its
interaction partner and a molecular switch which is mediated by this motif
instance.

Step 11. Scroll down to the "Interactions" header to view information about
this instance's interactions (Fig TP53-BP1-6). This instance interacts with PIN1_Human via the
"WW" domain (PFAM identifier PF00397; found on position 7--37 in PIN1_Human). If available, binding
affinities are also shown here. Interaction data is made available in Mitab and xml format (\cite{17925023}).

Step 12. Scroll further down to the "Switches" section for a brief overview of
the switches details of this instance obtained form "switches.ELM" (\cite{23550212}) (Fig TP53-BP1-6). This
particular instance is involved in the switch phosphorylating P53. Clicking

# Alternate protocol 2: General Search Box

A general search text box is available to explore the manually curated
information in the ELM DB. This is a "Full-text" search which is performed on
selected columns of the database therefore some attention (better term?) should
be applied when evaluating the retrieved results.

![](../Figures/TP53_3/TP53_instances.png)
**Figure TP53-AP1-1** 

![](../Figures/TP53_3/TP53_switches.png)
**Figure TP53-AP1-2** 

![](../Figures/TP53_3/TP53_candidates.png)
**Figure TP53-AP1-3** 

Example 1: perform a search using the keyword ‘p53’. The results are retrieved
in the following section: ELM instances (xx matches), ELM Switch (xx matches),
and ELM Candidate classes (xx matches). One will find proteins such as 
CDH1_YEAST (because of its accession P53197) which may or may not be 
what one wants.

![](../Figures/TP53_3/P04637_instances.png)
**Figure TP53-AP1-4** 

Example 2: perform a search using the gene id TP53 or the UniProt Acc P04637.
The results are retrieved in the following section: ELM instances (xx matches),
ELM Switch (xx matches).  The retrieved hits are less, but more specific
compared with the search with ‘53’. However, there are no matches in ELM
Candidate classes tough some content is related to the p53 protein.

# Basic Protocol 2: Predicting ELMs in sequences

One of the most useful (and used) features in ELM is the ability to detect
motifs in proteins and sequences. Given a protein's amino acid sequence, the
"EML Predictions" pipeline searches for occurrences of each motif class using
regular expressions, apply a set of filters to help judging results, and to
visualize resulting set of putative motifs.

In this protocol we will be viewing the manually annotated data of a typical
protein, using p53 (Uniprot ID: P53_HUMAN/P04637) as an example. We will cover
how to find the manually annotated motifs and instances, and how to find the
motif instances, the references used to annotate each instance, the
experimental protocols used, and additional information including relationships
to biological pathways (such as KEGG \cite{26476454}), diseases (from OMIM
\cite{17357067}) and molecular switches (in switches.ELM \cite{23550212}).

## Necessary Resources

### Software & Hardware

A modern browser such as Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.
ELM is best viewed on a laptop or desktop computer, although tablets and
smartphones will also work.

## Predicting ELM instances using data from ELM database

![](../Figures/TP53_1/elm_search.png)
**Figure TP53-BP1-1** The query input page for ELM for predicting motifs in a given protein sequence.

Step 1. Open a browser, and navigate to the ELM homepage: http://elm.eu.org.
Enter the Uniprot ID "P53_HUMAN" in the search field labelled "Enter a uniprot
identifier or accession number". The page should autocomplete/suggest the
protein "P53_HUMAN / P04637 (Homo sapiens)". Click on this entry to confirm
that we want to search for SLiM data for this protein. Click on "Submit" to
view the motif instance data for p53. (Fig. TP53-BP1-1)

> The autocompletion mechanism queries uniprot.org for protein identifier; if
> it succeeds, then additional information from uniprot will be used to
> pre-populate the filter boxes. In this example, P53_HUMAN is recognized as a
> Human protein, and so "Homo sapiens" is automatically filled in the
> "Taxonomic Context" field. Also, P53 has been annotated (by Uniprot) to be
> localized to nucleus, cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrion, so
> these are also automatically applied as search criteria. The motif cutoff of
> "100" is a sufficiently high (lenient) threshold to allow all other detected
> motifs to be shown.

step 3. Select the search criteria (optional). It is possible to limit the
   results by "cell compartment", "taxonomic context" or by changing the "motif
   probability cutoff". To restrict the search to include SLiM's that are
   active in certain cellular compartments, select one or more from the list
   (use the "control" key to select more than one option). It is also possible
   to select a "taxonomic context" to restrict the search to SLiMs from certain
   species. Start typing a species name in the "taxonomic context" input field to
   get an auto-completed list of species to select from.
   Additionaly, a "Motif probability cutoff" can be used to only retain ELM
   classes whose pattern probability is below the given value.
   For the current protocol, leave all of these at their default values: "not
   specified", "100" and no "taxonomic context"

TODO: Repeat search using stringent filters (homo sapiens, nucleus, 0.01)

## Interpreting the prediction results: Graphical Summary

step 4. Click "submit" to start the searching for motifs. 
   You will be brought to an intermediate page indicating that your results are
   being processed, and you should be redirected to the final results page within
   a minute.

> The Results are summarized in the first figure on the results page (see
> figure TP53-BP1-2). The graphical summary shows the results generated by the
> ELM prediction pipeline, combined with additional filters and information
> from external resources. The visualization should help you interpreting the
> results and to assess whether or not a motif is present in a sequence, as
> well as how likely it is to be functional based on its structural context and
> evolutionary conservation. Motif instances which are manually annotated in
> the database appear as red (TP) or yellow (FP) ovals in the graphic.
> Blue/gray squares represent predicted motif occurrences.
>
> You can bookmark this page: The results are stored for a week.

TODO: INSERT/CHANGE FIGURE/NAME

**Figure TP53-BP1-2** The graphical results summary of the ELM Prediction
pipeline for “P53_HUMAN”. Note that not all motif detections are shown (the
image is truncated at the bottom). The top five rows show a set of structural
features. Annotated and predicted motifs are shown as differently colored
ovals/boxes.


step 6. The first row contains phosphorylation sites as retrieved from
   Phospho.ELM (\cite{21062810}), and whether the phosphorylated amino acid is a
   serine, threonine or tyrosine. Phospho.ELM is a database of manually annotated
   phosphorylation sites obtained from scientific publications from low and
   high-throughput experiments. You can follow the link to Phospho.ELM by clicking
   on the phosphorylation site in the image to get more information on individual
   phosphorylation sites.

> Phosphorylation sites are only available when the search is performed with a
> protein accession (eg. *not* with FASTA sequence alone) in step XXX.
> Phosphorylation sites are relevant to interpret ELM motif predictions when
> the predicted motif requires to be phosphorylated (as in several docking and
> ligand binding motifs) and naturally, for the prediction of phosphorylation
> motifs.

step 7. The second row shows SMART and Pfam domains detected by the SMART
   database (\cite{9600884},\cite{25300481}, \cite{9600884}). Hover the mouse over
   these domains to see their names and exact start and end positions.

> In order to be functional SLiMs need to be accessble, and therefore they are
> usually not found within globular domains and structured regions
> (\cite{21909575}). Any SLiMs detected by the ELM prediction pipeline are less
> likely to be functional, and are indicated with a red background (see also the "structural filter" described in step XXX).

step 8.  The third row shows globular and disordered regions in the sequence as
   predicted by GlobPlot (\cite{12824398}). The fourth and fifth row contains
   results from IUPred (\cite{15955779}), another predictor of disordered protein
   regions. Protein segments with an IUPred score above 0.5 considered to be
   disordered.

>  SLiMs are typically only functional when found in intrinsically disordered
>  regions. Any motif occurrence detected by the ELM prediction pipeline that
>  falls within disordered regions are more likely to be functional.

step 9. The 5th row contains information on secondary structure. The secondary
   structure is predicted using a pipeline mapping motif occurrence onto high
   quality reference domain structures (\cite{19852836}). Check the graphical
   representation, if the output of the secondary structure filter and the
   disorder predictors agree with respect to wihch parts of the sequence are
   considered structured and which disordered.

step 10. The remainder of the figure (below “secondary structure” output)
   displays predicted and annotated motif instances, overlayed by the
   structural context from rows 2 and 3 (SMART domains and GlobPlot). A blue
   square indicates a single motif occurence, intensity of the color indicates
   the conservation of this sequence in homologous proteins. Boxes in gray are
   motif occurences which have been filtered out by the "structure filter".
   Boxes that are blue & gray are neutral (eg. residing in structural context,
   but the secondary structure detected a loop region). If the sequence is
   already present in the ELM database, any motif instances that have already
   been annotated are shown as ovals. Lastly, any motifs detected, which are
   annotated to be functional in homologous sequences, are shown as red/blue
   rectangles.

TODO: EXPLAIN / SHOW ANNOTATED INSTANCES

> In the case that not enough homologous sequences were detected to build an
> alignment, no conservation score can be calculated. Therefore all of the
> motif occurences will be shown in a uniform shade of blue.

step 11. Place the cursor over the blue box for motif occurence
   "MOD_PLK" at position 6-12. This motif is in a disordered region,
   and has not been filtered out by the structural filter. However, its
   conservation score is very low: 0.16, indicating it is not conserved
   in homologous proteins.

> The confidence score is based on how conserved the sequence is across a set
> of homolous proteins from other sequences. An full description of the method
> can be found in \cite{18460207}.

step 12. Mouse over a gray rectangle (indicating motifs which have been
   filtered out) to find out why this hit was filtered out. It shows scores for
   all of the individual criteria used by the secondary structure filter: The name
   of the domain, the *accessibility score* , *secondary structure score*,
   *combined total score*, and the associated *total score P-value*
   (\cite{19852836}).

TODO: CREATE FIGURE “FILTERING SUMMARY” FOR TP53

step 14. Scroll down to the section titled "Filtering Summary" to
   view some statistics about how many motifs and instances were filtered out
   (figure TP53-BP1-2). The first two lines contain information on whether and
   which filters were applied in step XXX of this protocol. The next two lines
   (SMART & Structural score) show how many motifs and instances were removed
   by the SMART and Secondary structure filters. The "Retained by" section
   shows how many motif hits were not filtered out by the "Smart" or
   "Structural Score" filter. In this example a total of XXX instances (of XXX
   different motifs were identified), of which XXX instances (and XXX motifs)
   were filtered out as they occured in a SMART domain.

**Figure TP53-BP1-3**

Step 15. On the results page, scroll down to the heading: "The ELMs in the
following table are known instances annotated from the literature" (Fig TP53-BP1-3).
This table has details of SLiMs which have been manually annotated in the ELM
database. The columns show each motif name, the sequence(s) that matched the
motif as well as their starting and ending positions and the logic of the annotation
followed by a short description of each motif, to which cell compartments its
has been associated, and finally the regular expression of the motif.

> The "Logic" column indicates whether this motif is an example of a functional
> (True Positive, TP) or non-functional (False Positive, FP) motif. A TP

> instance to be functional, whereas a FP is an instance with experimental

> true negative (TN) instance, which is an annotated instance where experiments
> have shown it to be non-functional.


TODO: INSERT/CHANGE FIGURE/NAME
step 16. Scroll down to the section with the header "Globular domains/ TM
   domains and signal peptide detected by the SMART server" (Figure BACT-BP-3).
   This section contains information on which domains were detected by the
   SMART server, and their positions. Clicking on their names will bring you to
   the SMART entry for that domain on the SMART homepage.

TODO: INSERT/CHANGE FIGURE/NAME
![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_results_motifs.png)
**Figure BACT-BP-7:** This table contains the list of motifs detected in the
sequence (only the top part of the table is shown).

TODO: INSERT/CHANGE FIGURE/NAME
step 17. Scroll further down to the section title "Results of ELM motif
   search after globular domain filtering, structural filtering and context
   filtering" to obtain an overview of all of the motifs and motif instances
   detected (Figure BACT-BP-7). Each row also contains information on the Motif
   name, the matching peptide sequence and its position. Additional information
   is shown about the ELM, cell compartment and its regular expression. If the
   motif was detected in a homologue, the column called "PHI-Blast Instance
   mapping" contains links to the Sequence alignment of the homologous protein,
   and a summary of the ELM instance mapper output. If a motif instance has
   been filtered out due to Structural criteria (SMART or Structure), this
   column contains a link to a page with details on how individual criteria
   that make up this filter. The last column contains information on the
   Probability filter: the probability reflects the chance to observe this
   motif in any random amino acid sequence.

TODO: INSERT/CHANGE FIGURE/NAME
![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_results_motifs_filtered.png)

TODO: INSERT/CHANGE FIGURE/NAME
step 18. Scroll further down to the heading "List of excluded ELMs falling inside
   SMART/PFAM domains and/or scoring poorly with the structural filter (if

# Alternate Protocol 1: Predicting ELMs in sequences


TODO: DEDUPLICATE TEXT (COMPARE TO 4-P53_BASIC_PROTOCOL_2.MD)

TODO: DESCRIBE MOST PROBABLE MOTIF INSTANCES (COMPARED TO FILTERED)

We will use protein "CV_0974" (uniprot ID: Q7NZE8) as an example, a "probable
tyrosine phosphatase" from _Chromobacterium violaceum_. This protein is predicted
to be a tyrosine phosphates because it has a "tyrosine phosphatase" (PTPc) domain.

## Necessary Resources

### Software & Hardware

A modern browser such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari.
ELM is best viewed on a laptop or desktop computer, although tablets and
smartphones will also work.

## Submitting a query to ELM

![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_search.png)
**Figure BACT-BP-1:** The input query page for finding motifs in ELM. The
sequence for _C. vilaceum protein_ CV_0974 was used as an example for this
protocol.

step 1. Click on the "ELM Predictions" button in the menu to access the search query
   page (Fig. BACT-BP-1). Here you can provide either a protein accession (from
   uniprot) or an amino acid sequence (simply the
   sequence, or a FASTA formatted entry) in which you want to detect SLiMs.
   Retrieve the FASTA formatted sequence from Uniprot
   (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7NZE8.fasta), and enter it into the "sequence
   input text box".

![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_results_summary.png)
**Figure BACT-BP-2:** The graphical results summary of the ELM Prediction pipeline
for Probable Tyrosine phosphate (CV_0974). Note that not all motif
detections are shown (the image is truncated at the bottom). The top five rows show a handfull of 
structural features. The motif occurence are shown as blue boxes, the intensity of which
indicates the conservation score. See steps XXX to YYY for more information.

step 4. The Results are summarized in the first figure on the results page (see
   figure BACT-BP-2). The Graphical summary shows all of the final and
   intermediate results generated by the ELM Prediction pipeline, and can be
   used infer whether or not a motif is present in a sequence, as well as now
   likely it is to be functional based on its structural context and
   evolutionary conservation. 

step 5. The first row contains phosphorylation sites as retrieved from Phospho.ELM
   (\cite{21062810}), and whether the phosphorylated amino acid is a serine, threonine
   or tyrosine. Phospho.ELM is a database of manually annotated phosphorylation
   sites obtained from scientific publications from low and high-throughput experiments. You can follow the link
   to Phospho.ELM by clicking on the phosphorylation site in the image.

> Phosphorylation sites are only available when the search is performed
> with a protein accession in step XXX.  Phosphorylation sites are relevant to
> interprete ELM motif predictions when
> the predicted motif requires to be phosphorylated (as in several docking and
> ligand binding motifs) and naturally, for the prediction of phosphorylation
> motifs.

step 6. The second row shows SMART and Pfam domains detected by the SMART
   database (\cite{9600884},\cite{25300481}, \cite{9600884}). Hover the mouse over these domains to
   see their names and exact start and end positions.

> In order to be functional SLiMs need to be accessble, and are therefore they
> are usually not found within domains and structured regions (\cite{21909575}). Any
> SLiMs detected by the ELM prediction pipleline are less likely to be
> functional, and are filtered out by the "structural filter" (see also step XXX).

step 7.  The third row shows globular and disordered regions in the sequence as
    predicted by GlobPlot (\cite{12824398}). The 4th & 5th
    rows contain results from IUPred (\cite{15955779}), another unstructured region
    prediction tool. Protein segments with an IUpred score above 0.5 are 95% likely
    to be disorered (REF???).

>  SLiMs are typically only functional when found in intrinsically disordered
>  regions. Any motif occurence detected by the ELM prediction pipeline that
>  fall within disoredered regious are more likely to be functional.

step 10. Place the cursor over the blue box for motif occurence
   "DOC_USP7_MATH_1" at position 129-133. This motif is in a disorered region, and
   has not been filtered out by the structural filter. However, its
   conservation score is extremely low: 0.000, indicating it is not conserved
   in homologous proteins. Place the cursor over motif "DOC_MAPK_DCC_7" at
   positions "334-343". Despite the high conservation score (1.000), this motif
   is inside the PTPc domain (and a Globular regions), and therefore has been
   filtered out.

## Interpreting the prediction results: Additional Information

![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_results_alignments_filtering_domains.png)
**Figure BACT-BP-3:** This section of the results contains additional details
of alignment of homologous proteins, filtering results and globular domains.

step 12. Scroll down to below the results graphic to find additional
   information on the ELM Predction pipeline's results (figure BACT-BP-3).
   The first section contains links to download or view the multiple sequence
   alignments of homologous proteins used to calculate the conservation score.
   Click on the link "Click here to enable the multiple sequence alignment
   viewer" to open the alignment in Jalview (note: this requires the Java browser
   plugin, which is not available on some newer operating systems).
   Alternatively you can also download the "alignment", "conservation features"
   and "phosphosite features" files separately to view on a standard
   (non-browser) installation of Jalview.

step 13. Scroll down to the section titled "Filtering Summary" to
   view some statistics about how many motifs and instances were filtered
   out (figure BACT-BP-3). The first two lines contain information on whether and which filters were
   applied in step XXX of this protocol. The next two lines (SMART & Structural
   score) show how many motifs and instances were removed by the SMART and
   Secondary structure filters. The "Retained by" section shows how many motif
   hits were not filtered out by the "Smart" or "Structural Score" filter. In
   this example a total of 156 instances (of 54 different motifs were
   identified), of which 63 instances (and 16 motifs) were filtered out as they
   occured in a SMART domain.

> Note that the graphical summary above does not contain sequences filtered
> out by the "cell compartment" and "taxonomic context" filters (in step XXX).
> However those filtered out by by the SMART and Structural scores are shown in the
> graphic above (as gray rectangles). If any "cell compartment" or "taxonomic
> context" filters are selected in step XXX, the number of motifs and instances
> are also shown in this table.

step 14. Scroll down to the section with the header "Globular domains/ TM
   domains and signal peptide detected by the SMART server" (Figure BACT-BP-3). This section
   contains information on which domains were detected by the SMART
   server, and their positions. Clicking on their names will bring you to the
   SMART entry for that domain on the SMART homepage.

![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_results_motifs.png)
**Figure BACT-BP-7:** This table contains the list of motifs detected in the
sequence (only the top part of the table is shown).

step 16. Scroll further down to the section title "Results of ELM motif
   search after globular domain filtering, structural filtering and context
   filtering" to obtain an overview of all of the motifs and motif instances
   detected (Figure BACT-BP-7). Each row also contains information on the Motif name, the matching
   peptide sequence and its position. Additional information is shown about the ELM, cell compartment and its regular
   expression. If the motif was detected in a homologue, the column called
   "PHI-Blast Instance mapping" contains links to the Sequence alignment of
   the homologous protein, and a summary of the ELM instance mapper output. If a
   motif instance has been filtered out due to Structural criteria (SMART or
   Structure), this column contains a link to a page with details on how
   individual criteria that make up this filter. The last column contains
   information on the Probability filter: the probability reflects the chance
   to observe this motif in any random amino acid sequence.

![](../Figures/BACT_1/elm_results_motifs_filtered.png)
**Figure BACT-BP-8:** This table contains the list of motifs detected in the
sequence (only the top part of the table is shown) which were excluded due to
structural filters.

step 17. Scroll further down to the heading "List of excluded ELMs falling inside
   SMART/PFAM domains and/or scoring poorly with the structural filter (if
   applicable)." (Figure BACT-BP-8). This table is (almost) identical to the
   one above, but shows motif instances which were rejecte by the Structural
   filter or SMART filter.

# Alternate Protocol 4: Predicting ELMS in sequences using REST API

Querying ELM for motifs in a given sequence (as discussed in basic protocol 1),
gives you a nice overview of putative and possibly annotated motifs in your
query protein with a graphical representation using colors to highlight
different regions of the protein sequence (eg. disordered vs. globular).
It is however difficult to analyse a large set of protein sequences in this
manner. Therefore, http://elm.eu.org provides an interface which you can use to submit your sequence
in a programmatic way. Of course, this way, you won't receive the graphical
output representation, but are limited to textual data representation.

Currently, there exists a single URL 'http://elm.eu.org/start_search/' to
accept such queries. You can choose to either submit a uniprot name or accession
(ex. 'http://elm.eu.org/start_search/P53_HUMAN.tsv') or submit your raw
sequence (ex. 'http://elm.eu.org/start_search/MAPRGFSCLLLLTSEIDLPVKRRA').

The logic here is, if the URL ends in '.tsv' then the server assumes you
are using a Uniprot id or accession; if it doesn't, then it assumes you are
using raw sequence. See below for details.

## Downloading all ELM classes

![](../Figures/BACT_2/elm_downloads_html.png)

**Figure ELM-Downloads:** The ELM downloads page, which holds information about
the different types of data (such as "Classes", "Instances", etc; see menu to
the right) that can be obtained from the server. The orange boxes are clickable
links, the URL following them are used to highlight the URL scheme used by the
server (bold font denotes specifics used in the examples such as query terms,
or formats).

step 1. Direct your browser to the URL 'http://elm.eu.org/downloads' or choose 'ELM Downloads' from the Menu at 'http://elm.eu.org' (see the [/Figures/elm_downloads_html.png](screenshot) figure showing the ELM downloads website).

> This webpage contains links and descriptions on how to download ELM data in text format.
> The information is separated in individual tables, eg. for 'Classes', 'Instances', and so on...
> Note that each table also shows the 'last modified date' indicating when the particular data was last updated.
> This is useful if you regularly want to update your local data with ELM data, as you can quickly check whether you actually _need_ to download the files again...
> Note the orange colored download links highlighting different formats:
> For many pages, which exist in html format (ending in '.html'), there also exists an additional URL/file extension to get the data in other formats.

step 2. Click on the first orange 'html' link in the table "Classes" or use the following URL: 'http://elm.eu.org/elms.html'

> This webpage shows all annotated ELM classes.
> Next, we are going to use the query parameter 'q' to limit our search

step 3. Use the following URL: 'http://elm.eu.org/elms.html?q=CSK'

> This will again show the webpage with all annotated ELM classes, this time however limited to those matching the query term 'PCSK'.
> Next, we are going to use the same URL pattern, but with '.tsv' to download the same data as actual data, not HTML.

More data (interactions, domains, methods, etc.) can be downloaded from ELM in
analogous fashion. Different formats are available depending on data type (the most
common format is TSV), for example ELM instances can be downloaded in TSV, FASTA, GFF, PIR,
or PSI-MI format (either XML or MiTab) [24067240].

*notes: Maybe mention how findings are relevant to the lab? For example:
Manually annotated content should be reliable, although one should look at the
'confidence' in the instance annotation. Predictions are probably trustworthy,
but you need to take into account the 'confidence score', and other features
like whether its in a domain, etc...*

## Background Information

**Im still not sure what's going to happen here :(**

In order to interpret the data contained in ELM and the results produced by the
ELM prediction tool, it is important to have a basic understanding of SLiM's
and how they are affected by their structural and biological context.

Taking into account additional information, besides a match to a sequence
pattern defining a SLiM, can greatly narrow the selection of putative motifs
for experimental validation. 

SLiM's operate via with interactions with other proteins, typically the surface
of a globular, domain in a protein, although some are known to bind to
disordered regions. As their name suggests, SLiMs are compact, being composed
of a limited number of adjacent amino acids. Most of a motif’s binding
specificity however is conferred by only a subset of these amino acids. Those
few residues that directly interact with the binding partner are evolutionary
conserved, although in many cases a subset of amino acids that share certain
properties (such as similar charge, size or hydrophobicity) are allowed in
these hotspot positions. In the motif positions that contribute little to the
interaction, there are even less constraints, i.e. a broader range of amino
acids is allowed in these positions (\cite{21909575}).
A first consequence of this degeneracy is that SLiMs co-operatively engage in
interactions of relatively low affinity. 
Hence these binding events are transient and reversible, and can be readily
modulated, for instance by PTM. 

![](../Figures/functional_classification_of_SLiMs.png)
**Figure functional_classification_of_SLiMs** For each ELM class, the
functional category to which it belongs is indicated by a three-letter prefix.
Each ELM class is defined by a regular expression. Peptide sequences in
proteins that match the regular expression of a specific ELM class and that
were experimentally validated to be functional motifs are captured as ELM
instances of that class. Degrons are a specific subtype of enzyme-recruiting
docking motifs (see text for a detailed description).
