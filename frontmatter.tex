\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

\emph{instructions: brief overview, no references, max 150 words}

The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource (http://elm.eu.org) is a
manually curated database of short linear motifs (SLiMs). This protocol
explains how to best use this resource and explains how to access the
database content (both manual and scripted access), how to interpret the
output, and how to predict novel putative motifs in any given protein
sequence.
