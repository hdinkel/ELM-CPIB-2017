\section{(Basic): Explore the content of the ELM DB}
\label{sec:explore_content}

The core of the ELM database is a repository of manually annotated motifs and
instances. As of December 2016, ELM contains over 260 motif classes categorized
into 6 different types: DOC (docking), LIG (Ligand binding), DEG (degradation),
CLV (cleavage), MOD (post translational modifications), and TRG
(targeting/anchoring) motifs (Figure functional\_classification\_of\_SLiMs).
These motifs are derived from various types of experiments reported in
literature. Each manually annotated motif also has a set of bona fide instances
(occurrences) of this motif. Currently, there are over 3000 annotated instances
annotated from over 2500 publications. The motif classes and motif instances
have been uploaded by a large group of annotators from around the globe. The
complete catalogue of manually curated data can be searched, browsed and
explored on the ELM website

TODO MARC: explain: elms, annotations, classes, instances, regular expressions. And links to GO, methods PSI. we use DOC CYCLIN etc as example.

\item The ELM database is an online web resource. Open a browser and navigate
	to \rurl{elm.eu.org} to visit the homepage
	(Fig. \ref{fig:explore_content_home}).
	This page shows a brief explanation of the ELM resource, and a form to 
	search for SLiMs (which we cover in further detail in 
	\ref{sec:predicting_p53} and \ref{sec:predicting_cv_0974}).
	The column to the right is the news column, and is continually
	updated with the latest news about changes and additions to the database.

\end{figure}

\item On the ELM homepage click on the menu link \button{ELM DB} for an overview of
	the database statistics (Fig. \ref{fig:explore_content_stats}).
	This page displays the types and amounts of annotations contained in
	the database and a few links to third-part databases.
	Each line contains at least one link which will take you
	to the corresponding contents page (for example, clicking on
	\button{ELM instances} will take you to the page displaying all of the
	annotated instances in the database).

\end{figure}

\item Click on the sub-menu \button{ELM classes} under \button{ELM DB} to visit
	the page listing all of the ELM classes
	(Fig. \ref{fig:explore_content_elms}).
	For each class, the following information is provided: ELM identifier,
	short description, regular expression, number of instances annotated
	for each class, and number of structures available. For details on each
	class, click on the ELM identifier; to get a list of annotated
	instances for an individual class, click on the number of instances.

	\sdesc{Use the search bar at the top of the page to filter for certain
		motif classes. For example, typing ``MAPK'' and hitting submit
		will perform a full-text search on all motif classes in the ELM
		database containing the term ``MAPK''. The green buttons on the
		left can also be used to filter this table. For example,
		toggling the ``DOC'' button will remove all ``DOC'' classes
		from the table (and clicking it again will bring them back).
		Lastly, the yellow \button{tsv} link can be used to export all
		motif classes as a ``tab separated values'' file.}

	probability score, the taxonomic distribution of the motif and which
	domain (if any) is responsible for the interaction.

	\sdesc{The probability score is the probability that the regular

	the ``logic'' of the instance.
	The ``\# Ev.'' indicates the number of experimental evidences
	associated with the annotation. ``Organism'' indicates in which  
	species in which the protein is found. Lastly the ``Notes'' column
	contains links to any ``interactions'' or ``switches'' present in the
	database, as well as links to PDB if this structure exists in PDB.

	\sdesc{The instance ``logic'' is an annotation of whether this is a
		\textit{bona-fide} instance, or whether it is a non-functional
		instance. \textit{TP} (True positive) indicates the instance is
		annotated with experimental evidence showing it is functional.
		\textit{FP} (False Positive) instances have experimental
		evidence suggesting function, but are believed to be
		non-functional after careful examination by our annotators.
		\textit{TN} (True Negative) instances have been experimentally
		determined to be non-functional, and \textit{U} (Unknown)
		instances do not have enough evidence to determine whether it
		is functional or not. The overwhelming majority of instances in
		ELM are \textit{TP}s.}
