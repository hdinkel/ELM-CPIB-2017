# Unit title: Eukaryotic Linear Motifs on the ELM database

**Deadline:** 15 December for us, 15 Jan for submission.

## Introduction

- Introduce the concept of Linear Motifs

- Mention the importance of a) experimental validation and b) biocuration

- Mention the need for central repositories of knowledge

- Mention the need for predictive tools for unknown sequences

## Basic Protocol: Searching the ELM database

- How does one search the content in the database.

- This section should highlight a "pipeline" of how someone might typically use ELM.

- This section should also help explain the structure of the database itself

- Mention the importance of ontologies & data standards 

- Include information on links / content contained within ELM 

- Include a section on links to other resources

- How one might start from the database, export content, and use it in a different program (e.g. pdf structures in chimera)

- Biological example: p53


## Basic Protocol: Predicting & Detecting ELMs in sequences

- How does one submit their own sequences to the database

- Brief explanation of what the pipeline does

- How do you interpret the results

- Biological example: SH2 & EPIYA in Bacteria


## Basic Protocol: Using REST API

- How does one fetch information from the database using the REST API

- How does one submit a single and a batch of sequences for analysis

- How to interpret the results in each case
