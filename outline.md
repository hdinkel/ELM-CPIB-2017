# Outline

## Introduction (Marc, Kim, Francesca)

- Introduce the concept of Linear Motifs

- Mention the importance of a) experimental validation and b) biocuration

- Mention the need for central repositories of knowledge

- Mention the need for predictive tools for unknown sequences

## Basic Protocol: Searching the ELM database (Francesca, Kim)

- How does one search the content in the database.

- This section should highlight a "pipeline" of how someone might typically use ELM.

- This section should also help explain the structure of the database itself

- Explain classes (types of classes), instances & regular expressions.

- Mention the importance of ontologies & data standards 

- Include information on links / content contained within ELM 

- Include a section on links to other resources

- How one might start from the database, export content, and use it in a different program (e.g. pdf structures in chimera)

- Biological example: p53


## Basic Protocol: Predicting & Detecting ELMs in sequences (Marc, Holger, Hugo)

- How does one submit their own sequences to the database

- Brief explanation of what the pipeline does

- How do you interpret the results

- Biological example: SH2 & EPIYA in Bacteria

*If need for examples / exercises, see our 
[training material](http://aidanbudd.github.io/ppisnd/trainingMaterial/holgerDinkel/linear_motifs/) from the EMBO courses*


## Basic Protocol: Using REST API (Marc, Holger)

- How does one fetch information from the database using the REST API

- How does one submit a single and a batch of sequences for analysis

- How to interpret the results in each case


# Tips / Guidelines (also see [styleguide](instructions2authors/bioinformatics-style-9.10.pdf) )
- "The primary audience for Current Protocols in Bioinformatics consists of molecular biologists who have an interest in applying bioinformatics tools to their own work, but who may have little to no computational experience."
- write in *protocol* style, with individual, sequential steps, ideally numbered
- the protocol steps should describe the actions performed, employing the active tense versus the passive
- give a summary / guideline on how to interpret the results, what might have gone wrong, what to look out for
- screenshots are good. more screenshots are more good
